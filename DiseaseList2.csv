Celiac disease and your child,"Celiac disease and your child
What is celiac disease?  
Celiac disease is a condition triggered by dietary gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley and rye.
Celiac disease is not a food allergy. It’s an auto-immune disorder: The person’s body responds to gluten by producing antibodies that attack its own tissues. When people with celiac disease eat foods with gluten, the small intestine becomes damaged. This damage makes it difficult for the body to absorb nutrients, which can lead to a number of health problems.
In children, undiagnosed celiac disease can affect growth and development.
Celiac disease affects about 1 in 100 people in Canada. If you have a close relative (such as a sibling or parent) with celiac disease, you have a greater chance of having the disorder.
What are the symptoms of celiac disease?  
In children, some of the more common symptoms of undiagnosed celiac disease are:
Poor growth or weight loss
Lack of appetite
Stomachaches or bloating
Diarrhea
Fatigue or irritability
Iron deficiency
However, about half of all people with celiac disease don’t have any gastrointestinal symptoms.
How do I know for sure my child has celiac disease?
Talk to your child’s doctor before taking gluten out of their diet. Otherwise, test results could be affected, making it difficult to correctly diagnose your child.
If your child’s doctor suspects celiac disease, they may order bloodwork to screen for the condition. If the blood test is positive, your child will be referred to a gastroenterologist for more tests and a formal diagnosis.
If your child is diagnosed with celiac disease, it is helpful to meet with a registered dietitian experienced with the gluten-free diet. The dietitian will help you learn more about meal planning, reading labels, and ensuring your child has a healthy, balanced diet. Talk to your doctor about a referral.
What is the treatment for celiac disease? Is there a cure?  
The good news is that any damage to the small intestine will heal once your child stops eating gluten.
There is no cure for celiac disease. The only treatment is a lifelong gluten-free diet, which means not eating any food with wheat, barley, or rye. Although oats do not contain gluten, they can be contaminated during harvest or processing, so it’s important to use oats labelled “gluten-free”.
Common gluten-containing foods include breads, pasta, pizza, many desserts, and breaded meats. However, all of these foods can be made gluten-free.
Many foods are naturally gluten-free: fruits, vegetables, legumes (like chick peas, lentils), most dairy products, fish, tofu, and unprocessed meats.
When you are preparing gluten-free foods, you need to ensure they are not contaminated by foods that contain gluten. To avoid cross-contamination:
Use a separate toaster for gluten-free bread.
When deep frying, use fat/oil that has never been used for gluten-containing foods.
Cook gluten-free pasta in water that has not been used to cook gluten-containing pasta.
Use separate cutting boards for gluten-free foods.
It might sound complicated at first, but you will quickly learn how to safely prepare gluten-free foods, how to read food labels for sources of gluten, and what questions to ask when you eat outside your home.
Canadian labelling laws are very clear, and packages must indicate if wheat is present.
Can my child still go to birthday parties?
Yes! Birthday parties, sleepovers and playdates are important for children to develop and nurture friendships (and they’re a lot of fun!). It takes some extra planning and preparation, but your child can participate. For example:
Talk to the host parents about celiac disease and your child’s needs. You might be surprised at how much they are willing to do to ensure your child is included in the fun.
You can make your own gluten-free birthday cake/cupcakes to send with your child to a party. Consider asking the host parent if you can make enough to share with everyone.
If the host is ordering take-out pizza, call the restaurant ahead of time to ask about gluten-free options and food preparation practices (to ensure there is no cross-contamination). You can also prepare your own gluten-free pizza in advance and send it with your child.
We have listed some resources below that have lots of ideas about daily living and special events.
How does celiac disease affect a child at school?  
Some of the symptoms of undiagnosed celiac disease described earlier may affect a child’s ability to learn. A child may be going to the bathroom often, or feel unwell. When celiac is diagnosed and a child adopts a gluten-free diet, those symptoms should resolve.
If your child does not have celiac disease, and you are considering a gluten-free diet because of a learning or behaviour concern, talk you your child’s doctor first.
What do my child’s teachers need to know?
If your child has celiac disease, let the school and teachers know. Describe how your child must follow a gluten-free diet and avoid cross contamination.
It should not be necessary to exclude children with celiac disease from any activities, since there are many ways to keep them safe. Have a communication system in place with your child’s teacher to share information, so that you have advance notice about special events involving food.
Other important points to discuss with teachers and school staff:
Students with celiac disease should not share foods. They should only eat foods they have brought from home, or that they know for certain are gluten-free. Older children can be taught to read labels on packaged foods.
Children should wash hands with soap and water before eating. Hand sanitizers are not adequate.
Eating areas should be freshly cleaned and wiped down before lunch or snacks.
Ask the teacher to contact you if they think (or know) that your child has ingested gluten.
Some craft materials may contain gluten, such as play-dough, papier maché, slime, finger paint, or pasta/cereal. Although gluten must be ingested to cause damage, young children may put unclean hands in their mouths, and cuticles and nail beds are hard to clean properly in the classroom.
Ask your child’s teacher what craft materials are used in the classroom, and whether they can be substituted with gluten-free products. If not, ask whether your child can wear gloves for those particular crafts.

Type 1 diabetes and COVID-19,"Type 1 diabetes and COVID-19
If you have a child or adolescent with type 1 diabetes (T1D), you probably have questions related to COVID-19. You may have also heard reports suggesting a link between T1D and COVID-19. This document will help answer your questions and concerns.
Can COVID-19 cause type 1 diabetes?
Recent research has found that since the start of the pandemic, the number of children and youth diagnosed with type 1 diabetes has increased in some areas. While this suggests that there could be an association between SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that cause COVID-19) and developing diabetes, it is not yet known if the virus causes diabetes.   
We know from pre-pandemic times that there are 2 ways a virus might affect the development of T1D:
It is believed that a virus may trigger the auto-immune reaction that gradually destroys insulin-producing cells (islets) in the pancreas – the stage known as “pre-diabetes”. Over a period of months to years, the number of islets decreases and at a critical level, blood sugars rise and “diabetes” is diagnosed. 
Some children and youth newly diagnosed with T1D recently had a virus. That doesn’t mean the virus caused diabetes, but the added stress on the body may cause a child with silent “pre-diabetes” to convert to diabetes sooner. These children and youth would have eventually started showing signs of T1D. 
It is too early to know whether SARS-CoV-2 is a trigger to develop pre-diabetes or is speeding up an auto-immune process that has already started. It will take months to years of experience and research before we can answer this question.
Researchers have also found that more children and youth are sicker and have diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at the time of diagnosis. This is concerning, since DKA is a very serious and potentially life-threatening condition.
The best way to prevent DKA is to know the signs of untreated or undiagnosed T1D, which are:
Excessive thirst
Frequent urination
Weight loss
Lethargy
A child or youth with these symptoms should see a doctor right away.
Sometimes the symptoms of undiagnosed T1D are mistaken for flu, a bladder infection, or may show up as bedwetting in a child who was previously dry at night.
Are children with type 1 diabetes at higher risk of serious illness from COVID-19?
Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disorder, but this does not mean that people with T1D are immunocompromised or have a weakened immune system.
Fortunately, vaccines prevent serious illness from COVID-19. All children 5 years and older should receive 2 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, 8 weeks apart. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) recommends that youth aged 12 to 17 with underlying medical conditions like type 1 or type 2 diabetes also receive a booster shot (current as of January 28, 2022).
Having any virus or illness can affect blood sugars in people with T1D. Since the chances of high blood sugar and ketones are increased when your child is ill, make sure you are familiar with sick day guidelines. In particular, know:
How to check for and manage ketones, which can develop with high blood sugar. You can use a blood ketone meter or urine strips. Ensure you have supplies on hand at all times and check expiry dates.
How to prevent DKA (diabetic ketoacidosis), a serious complication of diabetes caused by not having enough insulin. DKA must be treated in hospital.
How and when to use mini-doses of glucagon, for children with low blood sugar who are vomiting and cannot take fast-acting sugar. If your clinic hasn’t trained you to do this, ensure you know when to call for help. Have an injectable glucagon kit on hand, even if you have a nasal glucagon product (Baqsimi) as well.
Since anyone with viral symptoms must self-isolate for a period of time, always have a supply of diabetes supplies and medications at home.
How can I prevent my child or youth with type 1 diabetes from developing DKA?
Symptoms of DKA include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, high blood sugar and ketones (which cause fruity-smelling breath, and laboured, rapid breathing). Without treatment, DKA can be life-threatening.
Here are some things you can do to prevent DKA:
If your child is sick and/or has ketones, follow your clinic’s sick day guidelines.
NEVER stop insulin: During an illness, even if your child is not eating well, insulin needs are usually higher.
If your child uses an insulin pump, make sure you have either syringes or an insulin pen on hand, in case you need to give fast-acting insulin by injection. Have a supply of basal (long-acting) insulin on hand in case your child’s pump malfunctions.
Keep your child well hydrated with sugar-free fluids.
Even if your child needs to isolate in their room, they still need your help to manage their diabetes. 
Even if your child/teen often manages the diabetes fairly independently, during illness or stressful times they will need extra support from you.
Seek help from your team as directed.
If your child is showing signs of DKA, you need to seek medical attention immediately.
What else can I do?
Do what you can to prevent all family members from contracting COVID-19:
Get vaccinated: Ensure everyone in your household who can be vaccinated against COVID-19 is up-to-date with those vaccines. Right now, children 5 to 17 should receive 2 doses. NACI (as of Jan. 28, 2022) recommends booster doses for 12-17 year olds with chronic medical conditions including type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Anyone over 18 years should receive 2 doses, plus a booster (3 in total). Contact local public health authorities for information about when and where to be vaccinated.
Wear properly fitted masks: Remind children to wear their mask securely, both in school and on the bus.
Stay home when you are sick or having symptoms of viral illness, including COVID-19. Check the website of your province/territory or local public health authority for symptom screening tools.
Reduce the number of contacts you have, as much as possible.
Use at-home tests when experiencing symptoms of COVID-19: While supplies of rapid antigen tests (RATs) have recently been limited, provinces and territories are expected to have more available in the coming weeks. In some places, tests will be provided to school staff and students.
Find out what is happening at your child’s school: Many schools boards have put information about safety measures—including mask availability and ventilation—on their websites.
Ensure all your child’s vaccines are up to date, including an influenza vaccine.

Type 1 diabetes in school,"Type 1 diabetes in school
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic disease in which the pancreas doesn’t produce insulin, a hormone that allows the body to convert glucose (sugar) into energy or to store it in cells. Without insulin, glucose levels in the blood become dangerously high. Untreated type 1 diabetes is life-threatening. The only treatment is insulin, which is administrated through multiple daily injections or through a pump.
About 1 in 300 children have type 1 diabetes. They need frequent blood sugar checks each day and regular doses of insulin. There are many factors that affect blood sugar levels and the amount of insulin needed, including food, physical activity, illness, and stress
How does type 1 diabetes affect a child in school?
Managing type 1 diabetes at school is important for children’s short- and long-term health. Blood sugars that are too high or too low can affect a child’s ability to learn. Blood sugar levels can change quickly, so it’s important that school staff are educated, equipped and available to support students.
At a minimum, all students have to check their blood sugar throughout the day. If their blood sugar is too low (hypoglycemia), they need to treat it by eating a fast-acting sugar. Many students will also take insulin during the school day, when they eat or to correct a high blood sugar. They’ll do this either by injection or through an insulin pump that they wear on their body. Some students also wear a device to monitor their blood sugar.
While older students may be independent, many younger students will need an adult to help with or supervise these tasks. Even students who are independent may need help if they are unwell.
Some families worry that their child won’t have the proper support to deal with diabetes at school. They wonder:
Will my child be excluded from activities because there is no one to help with diabetes-related tasks?
What happens if my teen has low blood sugar just before an exam?
Can my child go on field trips?
Is my child safe during the day? What happens if their blood sugar goes low?
These are just some of the situations students with diabetes may face in school.
With support and planning, students with diabetes can participate fully in all school activities. Events involving food, for example, may require extra insulin to keep blood sugar levels in range. Because physical activity lowers blood sugar, changes to the typical routine (like a track meet, for example) need to be communicated to parents so they can either adjust insulin levels or provide an extra snack.
Is there support for students with type 1 diabetes in schools?
Support for students with type 1 diabetes in schools varies across Canada. Resources and policies are different across the country, even among schools in the same city or the same school board.  
Through Diabetes@School – a program developed by the Canadian Paediatric Society, the Canadian Pediatric Endocrine Group, and Diabetes Canada—educators and other school staff can access a number of resources to help them support students with type 1 diabetes. The Diabetes@School website has a list of provincial policies on type 1 diabetes in school.
The Canadian Paediatric Society and the Canadian Pediatric Endocrine Group have established minimum standards for care that will allow schools to create a safe and supportive environment for students with type 1 diabetes.
What are the responsibilities of a parent or guardian and the school?
Both the Canadian Paediatric Society and Diabetes Canada believe that supporting children and youth with diabetes at school should be a shared responsibility between families (including the students), schools, and, as needed, a health care provider.
Although parents or guardians should be responsible for the daily management decisions around their child’s diabetes (e.g., medications and storage, frequency of blood sugar monitoring, carbohydrate counting, determining insulin doses), school staff should be equipped (and trained, as needed) to provide the student with reliable hands-on support and supervision. 
Each school year, parents (with help from their diabetes care team, as needed) should develop a detailed Individual Care Plan (ICP) for their child. This plan should include a daily diabetes management plan and a diabetes emergency plan for school staff. The ICP should also outline roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the student’s well-being.
Parents should review and finalize their child’s ICP with input from school staff. They may also want to review it with their physician. The school principal should then share it with all staff who are in contact with the student on a regular basis.
What resources are available to school staff?
School staff should be educated, equipped and available to support students with type 1 diabetes. In many cases, parents will be the ones to take the lead on this education. There are many excellent resources to help, including:
Diabetes at School: A resource for families, schools and caregivers to help school-aged children with type 1 diabetes. Includes a video series that makes it easy to learn about how to support students with type 1 diabetes in school.

COVID-19 and your child,"COVID-19 and your child
COVID-19 is an illness caused by a coronavirus. Human coronaviruses are common and are typically associated with mild illnesses, similar to the common cold.
What are the symptoms?
Symptoms may be very mild or more serious. Symptoms usually start within 5 days of exposure to the virus, but may take up to 10 days to appear. Symptoms may include:
Fever
Sore throat
Cough
Difficulty breathing
Children with certain chronic conditions may have more severe COVID-19 disease than healthy children.
How can I protect my family?
The Canadian Paediatric Society urges all eligible children and youth 6 months of age and older to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available to them. Children are unlikely to get very sick if they have all recommended vaccine doses.
The vaccine is safe. All vaccines go through a very specific and scientifically strict process of testing and review to make sure they are safe and effective.
Encourage your child to help stop the spread of COVID-19 by teaching them to do the same things everyone should do to stay healthy:
Wash hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.
Stay home if you are sick.
Follow local public health advice on wearing masks and social distancing in indoor public places. Recommendations may be different in some places depending on the levels of COVID-19 infections in that area. Regardless, you may want to have your child wear a mask if they have a chronic condition that makes them more at risk for severe COVID-19 infection.
Clean frequently touched objects and surfaces.
Sneeze and cough into your sleeve.
Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.
Avoid contact with people who have colds or are coughing.
What should I do if I think my child is sick?
Children who have mild COVID-19 symptoms are able to stay at home with a caregiver throughout their recovery without needing hospitalization. You do not need to take your child to the emergency room with mild symptoms.
Get medical advice if your child is not drinking well, has a high fever, has trouble breathing, or if symptoms continue or worsen.
DO NOT call 911 unless it is an emergency.
I have heard of an inflammatory illness possibly linked to COVID-19 in kids. Should I be concerned?
A hyper inflammatory illness (Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in children [MIS-C]) has been reported in a small number of children a few weeks after having COVID-19. Some children develop symptoms like a fever that lasts at least 3 days, pink eyes, rashes, swollen hands and feet and severe stomach pain. Researchers believe that symptoms may be a delayed inflammatory response to the virus.
The best way to prevent MIS-C is for all eligible children to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
I just had a baby. Can people come visit? 
For young infants, avoiding all respiratory viruses is important. Consider fewer visitors, encourage regular handwashing and mask wearing. Ask friends and family not to visit if they feel sick. You can also contact your local public health authority for more guidance.
How can I talk to my child about COVID-19?
An infectious disease outbreak such as COVID-19 can be hard for children and teens to cope with and understand. How your child or teen responds will depend on their age, temperament, and developmental level. Please consult our resource, Helping children and teens cope with stressful public events, for more guidance. 
There are a few specific things you can do and say to build your child’s resilience:
Reassure your child that many doctors, nurses, and scientific experts around the world are working hard to keep us safe and healthy.
Let them know that a vaccine became available very quickly and many people are now protected from severe infection. Health care providers know how to take care of people who have severe infection.
Children are observant and pick up on our expressions and emotions. Help them to understand, verbalize and organize their own feelings around the pandemic.
Find out what they know and correct any misinformation about COVID-19.
Be honest, but positive. Reinforce that they are unlikely to get very sick, but that it is still important that they do their part to protect themselves and their families -- especially those who are at higher risk.
Be mindful of your child’s exposure to the news. Model good media habits and try to limit the news running in the background. Explore child-appropriate options and watch together.

Colds in children,"Colds in children
The ‘common cold’ is caused by viruses (germs) that infect the nose, throat and sinuses. Colds are most common in the fall and winter when people are indoors and in close contact with each other.
It may seem like your child has one cold after another all winter. Young children haven’t built up immunity (defenses) to the more than 100 different cold viruses that are around. That’s why they can get as many as 8 to 10 colds each year before they turn 2 years old. Once you have had a cold virus, you become immune to that specific germ. That’s why children get fewer colds as they get older.
How do colds spread?
Children can catch colds from siblings, parents, other family members, playmates or caregivers. Germs usually spread in one of 3 ways:
Direct contact—such as kissing, touching or holding hands—with an infected person. If you have a virus, you will have germs in your nose, mouth, eyes and on your hands. By touching other people, you can pass on the virus.   
Indirect contact means touching something—a toy, doorknob or a used tissue—that has been touched by an infected person and now has germs on it. Some germs, including those that cause colds and diarrhea, can stay on surfaces for many hours.  
Through the air when a person coughs or sneezes. Droplets from the cough or sneeze can reach another person’s nose or mouth.  
How do I know if my child has a cold?
Typical cold symptoms include:
runny or stuffed-up nose,
sneezing,
coughing,
headache,
mild sore throat,
loss of appetite,
fatigue (being tired), and
mild fever.  
The influenza (flu) virus causes high fever, cough and body aches. It strikes more quickly than a cold and makes people feel worse. Children with colds usually have energy to play and keep up their daily routines. Children with the flu are usually in bed.
When should I call my doctor?
Babies under 3 months of age can find it hard to breathe through a stuffed-up nose, which can make feeding difficult. Call your doctor to make an appointment or take your baby to an emergency department if your baby:
is having trouble breathing,
is not eating or is vomiting, or  
has a fever (rectal temperature of 38.5°C or higher).
Some respiratory viruses that cause colds in older children and adults may cause more serious illness in babies and toddlers. These illnesses include croup (hoarseness, noisy breathing, barking cough), pneumonia (lung infection), bronchiolitis (wheezing, trouble breathing), or sore eyes, sore throat and neck gland swelling. Children with these conditions need to be seen by a doctor.
Children of all ages should see a doctor if the cold seems to be causing more serious problems. Call your doctor or take your child to an emergency department if you notice your child:
is breathing rapidly or seems to be working hard to breathe,
has blue lips,  
is coughing so badly that they are choking or vomiting,
wakes in the morning with one or both eyes stuck shut with dried yellow pus,
is much sleepier than usual, doesn’t want to feed or play, or is very fussy and cannot be comforted, or
has thick or coloured (yellow, green) discharge from the nose for more than 10 to 14 days.
Call your doctor if your child shows any sign of a middle ear infection (ear pain, drainage from the ear), which can be caused by a cold.
What can I do if my child has a cold?  
There is no cure for the common cold. Colds usually last about a week but can continue for as long as 2 weeks. They usually go away on their own.
Keep your child as comfortable as possible. Offer plenty of fluids and small, nutritious meals.  
Check your child’s temperature.
To ease pain, aches or a fever, use acetaminophen. Ibuprofen may be used for children over 6 months old. 
Don't give acetylsalicylic acid (ASA [eg, Aspirin])—or any medicine containing it—to children and teenagers with colds because it can lead to brain and liver damage (Reye syndrome).
If your baby or toddler is having trouble breastfeeding because of a stuffed-up nose, use a suction bulb to clear mucus from the nose. Use can use saline nose drops or spray if the mucus is very thick. 
Don’t give over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines (which don’t need a doctor’s prescription) to children younger than 6 years old unless your doctor prescribes them.
Decongestants and antihistamines (medicine to clear nasal and sinus congestion) will not help with coughing. Decongestants taken by mouth do not work very well and can cause your child to get a rapid heartbeat or to have trouble sleeping. Antihistamines do not work for colds.
Medicated nose drops or sprays provide only brief relief and shouldn’t be used for more than 2 to 3 days. They can actually make the congestion worse. Don’t use these products in children under 6 years old.
Cool mist humidifiers are not recommended because of the risk of contamination from bacteria and mold. If you do use one, disinfect it daily. Hot water vaporizers are not recommended because of the risk of burns.
Antibiotics will not help get rid of a cold. Antibiotics should be used only when children develop more serious illness caused by bacteria, such as an ear infection or pneumonia.
Children can continue their normal activities if they feel well enough to do so. If they have fever or complications, they may need a few days of rest at home. Your child can go to school if they feel well enough to take part in the activities.
Children with colds can still play outside.
How can I prevent a cold?  
Handwashing is the most important way to reduce the spread of colds:
Wash your hands after coughing, sneezing or wiping your nose.  
Wash your hands after being in contact with someone who has a cold.  
Wash your own hands and your child’s hands after wiping their nose.  
When water and soap are not available, use pre-moistened hand wipes or alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Keep sanitizers out of your child’s reach because they may be harmful if swallowed.  
Keep babies under 3 months old away from people with colds, if possible.
Teach your children to cover their nose and mouth with tissues when they sneeze or cough, or to cough into their upper sleeve or elbow.  
Avoid sharing toys that young children place in their mouths until they have been cleaned.
Avoid sharing cups, utensils or towels with others until they have been cleaned.
If your child attends daycare, tell the caregiver about any symptoms and ask if your child should stay home that day.
Make sure your child receives all of the recommended immunizations. While vaccines won’t prevent colds, they will help prevent some of the complications, such as bacterial infections of the ears or lungs.

Common infections and your child,"Common infections and your child
It may seem like your child is always sick. That’s because young children are exposed to many new germs (viruses or bacteria) and haven’t yet built up enough defenses against them. Most young children will have 8 to 10 colds a year. The good news is that most of these infections are mild and won’t last very long. As children get older, they get sick less often. 
How do infections spread? 
Germs usually spread in one of the following ways:
Direct contact with a person who has germs in the nose, mouth, eyes, stool or on the skin. Direct contact can include kissing, touching or holding hands with a person who has an illness.
Indirect contact with an infected person, who may spread germs by touching or mouthing an object such as a toy, a doorknob, or a used tissue that is later touched by another person. The germs can cause infection when that person—who now has germs on their hands—touches their eyes, nose or mouth. Some germs can stay on countertops or toys for many hours.
Droplets transmission is very common. Germs in the nose and throat can spread through droplets when the infected person coughs or sneezes without a tissue to cover the mouth and nose. Droplets travel through the air and can reach another person who is close by (less than a metre away). These germs don’t stay in the air and don’t travel over long distances.
Airborne spread is much less common. This happens when germs stay in the air and are carried around on air currents. These germs can infect people who are not close to the infected person and may even be in a different room. Chickenpox and measles viruses spread this way. These germs are hard to control. The best way to protect your child is with vaccines against these infections.
An adult can also spread germs from one child to another by indirect contact without realizing it. For example, if you’re changing a diaper or helping your child use the toilet or wiping your child’s nose, you may come into contact with germs. If you don’t wash your hands well afterward, you can pass these germs to another child.

Sometimes fever 
Croup
Cold symptoms and fever
Hoarse voice, barking cough
Rapid noisy breathing, difficult breathing
Croup can be treated at home by taking children into cool night air. Dress your child in warm clothing and go outside for 10 minutes. If your child's symptoms don't improve after 30 minutes, call your child's doctor.
Because attacks often happen in the middle of the night, you may have to go to the emergency department.
Influenza
Fever, chills, cough with or without headache, muscle aches, extreme tiredness, and sore throat
Loss of appetite is common
Influenza can be prevented by vaccine. An antiviral medication may be prescribed for healthy people with severe influenza or very young children. They should be taken within 48 hours of the first symptoms to be most effective.
Strep throat and scarlet fever
Fever, sore throat, swollen tender neck glands
With scarlet fever, red dry rash (like sandpaper) covering the body
Direct contact
Droplets transmission
Most sore throats are not strep throat and do not require an antibiotic. If you think your child has strep throat, see your doctor.
A throat swab is needed to diagnose strep throat.
Ear infection
Earache
Crankiness or fussiness
Sometimes tugging at ears
Rarely, fluid draining from the ear
Child may have fever or cold symptoms
Almost always starts as a cold, but the ear infection itself is not contagious
See your doctor, an antibiotic may be needed.
Rashes
Fifth disease

(Parvovirus)
Red rash on the cheeks spreads over the rest of the body after a couple of days
Child not very ill
Not contagious once the rash appears
Direct contact
Indirect contact with germs in saliva, on hands, tissues
Goes away on its own.
If you are pregnant and your child has fifth disease, see your doctor as it can harm the fetus.
Impetigo
Fluid-filled blisters usually around the mouth or nose, but may occur elsewhere
Blisters break, ooze, and form a honey-coloured crust
Direct contact with skin of infected person
Indirect contact with germs on clothing, towels, etc.
Gently wash the infected skin with clean gauze and soap.
This is a bacterial infection so you must see your doctor for treatment.
Molluscum contagiosum
Tiny “pinpoints” on the skin 1 to 6 months after exposure to the virus
Pinpoints turn into pinkish-white bumps that are smooth and shiny, have a dip in the middle and have a milky-white cheesy material inside
Bumps can appear anywhere on your child’s body
Most children get 1 to 20 bumps, but some can have hundreds
Not very contagious
Direct contact with bumps, or indirect contact (e.g., bedding contaminated with material from the bumps).
Scratching can spread the infection from one part of the body to another.
See doctor to confirm that it is molluscum contagiosum.
Wash hands often. 
Make sure your child doesn’t share towels with others.
Your child can continue to attend child care and/or school.
Roseola
Usually in babies under 1 year old, but can in seen in children up to 2 years old

If vomiting, give clear fluids only until your child has gone 6 hours without vomiting. An oral rehydration solution is the best clear fluid if your child will take it. You can also try diluted apple juice.
If your child is having diarrhea only or once vomiting stops, try milk and frequent small feeds with foods your child enjoys.
Seek medical help if there is blood in your child’s stool, your child is vomiting for more than 4  to 6 hours, is not drinking well or shows any signs of dehydration.
Give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever if your child is uncomfortable.*
*When giving ibuprofen, be sure that your child drinks lots of fluid. Do not give ibuprofen if you are worried about dehydration. Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months without first talking to your doctor.
How can I protect my child? 
Washing your hands and your child’s hands is the best thing that you can do to stop the spread of germs. Wash your hands after:
Coughing or sneezing into your hands or wiping your nose.
Using the toilet or helping your child to use the toilet
Caring for someone with any kind of infection.
Cleaning up vomit or diarrhea. 
Wiping your child’s nose.
Changing a diaper.
Handling raw meat.
Handling pets or animals.
When your child is old enough, teach them to wash their hands after wiping their nose or using the toilet. 
Wash your hands before preparing or serving food and before eating, and teach your child to do the same.
If your child has a cough or cold, cover their mouth and nose with tissues when they cough or sneeze. When they are old enough, teach them to cover their nose and mouth with a tissue when they sneeze or cough, to put the used tissue in a wastebasket right away, and to wash their hands after. Teach them to cough or sneeze into the curve of their  elbow if they don't have a tissue.
If your child attends child care, tell the caregiver about any symptoms and ask if your child should stay home that day. When both parents work outside the home, plan ahead by making other arrangements for someone to care for your child when they are sick. 
Make sure your child has received all of the recommended vaccines.
What can I do if my child is sick? 
Do not give OTC medications to babies and children under 6 years old without first talking to your doctor.
When your child is sick, you want them to feel better. Many parents turn to over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines for help. There is no proof that these medications work. In fact, some of the side effects can make your child feel even worse. The only exceptions are drugs used to treat fever (such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen). 
However, medication is not always needed to reduce a child’s temperature. Talk to your doctor if your baby (under 6 months) has a fever. 
There is also a risk of giving your child too much medication. For example, giving acetaminophen for a fever on top of a cough syrup that already contains acetaminophen may result in an overdose of acetaminophen. Never use more than one product at the same time unless advised by your doctor.
When should I call my doctor? 
If your child shows any of the following signs:
Fever and is less than 6 months old.
Fever for more than 72 hours.
Coughing that won’t go away (lasts more than a week) or is severe and causes choking or vomiting.
Earache.
Excessive sleepiness.
Won’t stop crying or is very irritable all the time.
Rapid or difficulty breathing.
Diarrhea and is younger than 6 months old.
Bloody or black stools.
Vomiting for more than 4-6 hours.
Dehydration (dry sticky mouth, no tears, no urine or fewer than 4 wet diapers in 24 hours in infants and fewer than 3 wet diapers in 24 hours in older children).

Croup (laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis),"Croup (laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis)
What is croup?
Croup is an infection of the throat, vocal cords (or larynx), and large airways of the lungs. It can be caused by several different viruses. When children younger than 5 years of age have the infection, it’s called croup. In older children, it’s called laryngitis.
How does croup spread?
Croup is most common in the winter and early spring. The viruses that cause croup spread the same way as a common cold:
By touching the hands of someone who has the infection.
By touching something that has been touched by someone who has the infection.
By coming in contact with the virus in the air, after an infected person has coughed or sneezed.
What are the symptoms?
It often begins like a cold, but then the child develops a fever and cough.
The lining of the throat and larynx (voice box) becomes red and swollen.
Your child’s voice gets hoarse and they develop a cough that sounds like a bark. This is often worse at night.
Your child may have difficulty breathing, and it may be rapid and noisy.
Activity that increases the rate of breathing (even crying or excitement) could make your child sound worse.
Your child may become tired because of the extra work it takes to breathe.
What can parents do? 
In most cases, croup sounds worse than it actually is and will clear up on its own within 5 to 7 days. In severe cases, your child’s breathing can become difficult and they will have to be treated in hospital. Antibiotics are not used to treat croup because it is caused by a virus, not by a bacteria.
Keep your child as calm and comfortable as possible and offer plenty of fluids.
Give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever. Ibuprofen should only be given if your child is drinking reasonably well. Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months of age without first talking to your doctor.
Clear nasal congestion with a bulb syringe and saline (saltwater) nose drops. 
Take your child outside for a few minutes if it’s a cold day. Breathing in the cool air may ease symptoms.
Do not give over-the-counter cough and cold medicines to children younger than 6 years old unless your doctor prescribes one. The only exception is medication used for fever.
If you give medication for fever, read the instructions carefully and do not give more often than listed on the label. 
See your doctor if symptoms continue or worsen. Your doctor might prescribe a medicine to help relieve the symptoms.
For cases of very mild croup, your child may continue to attend a child care facility or school once they feel well enough to take part in activities.
Talk to your doctor or go to the hospital if your child:
Has a fever for more than 72 hours or is younger than 6 months and has a fever.
Has rapid or difficult breathing, or bluish coloured lips.
Is drooling a lot.
Is refusing to swallow because of a very sore throat.
Has a hard time lying down because it is hard to breathe.
Is lethargic (drowsy and listless).

Dehydration and diarrhea in children: Prevention and treatment,"Dehydration and diarrhea in children: Prevention and treatment
What is diarrhea?
Diarrhea is a very common problem in babies and children. It is usually mild and brief.  “Acute” diarrhea lasts less than 1 week, and no longer than 14 days.
A child has diarrhea if they have more bowel movements than usual, and if stools are less formed and more watery. Sometimes children with diarrhea have other symptoms, such as fever, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pains, cramps, and blood and/or mucus in the bowel movement.
Diarrhea can be dangerous if not managed properly because it drains water and salts from your child’s body. If these fluids are not replaced quickly, your child can become dehydrated and may need to be hospitalized.
How does diarrhea spread?
Diarrhea germs spread easily from person to person, and especially from child to child. They usually spread quickly among children who have not learned to use the toilet.
What causes diarrhea?
There are many different causes of diarrhea. The most common are viral infections.
How can I prevent diarrhea?
Proper handwashing and safe food handling are the best ways to prevent the spread of germs that cause diarrhea.
What should I do if my child has diarrhea?
Children with diarrhea need to keep drinking the right amount of fluids to avoid dehydration.
If you are breastfeeding, keep feeding on demand. You can also offer your child the foods he or she usually eats.
If you are formula feeding, do not dilute the formula. Continue formula feeding and offer your child the food he or she normally eats.
If you're not breastfeeding or formula feeding, offer your child a variety of fluids more frequently, in addition to the foods they normally eat.
At any age, if your child is not taking other fluids well, offer an oral rehydration solution (ORS), in addition to the feeding recommendations above. 
What is dehydration?
Dehydration is caused by a loss of body fluids, which are made up of water and salts. When children have diarrhea, they can lose large amounts of salts and water from their bodies can become dehydrated very quickly. Children can get dehydrated even more quickly if they are vomiting.
Dehydration can be very dangerous, especially for babies and toddlers.
What are the signs of dehydration?
Call your child’s doctor or seek medical advice at a local clinic or hospital if you see signs of dehydration, including:
decreased urination (fewer than 4 wet diapers in 24 hours in infants and fewer than 3 wet diapers in 24 hours in older children),
increased thirst, 
absence of tears, 
dry skin, mouth and tongue, 
faster heartbeat, 
sunken eyes, 
grayish skin, 
sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on your baby’s head. 
Healthy children can spit up, vomit or have a loose stool once in a while without being in danger of becoming dehydrated.
What is an oral rehydration solution?
An oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a mixture of water, salts and sugar in specific amounts. These solutions can be absorbed even when your child has large amounts of diarrhea or is vomiting.   
Oral rehydration solutions can be used to:
keep children well hydrated when they have significant amounts of diarrhea. 
replace lost fluids when children show signs of mild dehydration. 
Oral rehydration solutions are available at pharmacies in ready-to-serve preparations. It is best to buy an ORS that has already been mixed.
For the first 4 hours of oral rehydration (for mild dehydration)
Babies under 6 months of age 30 to 90 mL (1 to 3 oz.) every hour
Children 6 months to 2 years of age 90 to 125 mL (3 to 4 oz.) every hour
Over 2 years of age At least 125 to 250 mL (4 to 8 oz.) every hour
If your child refuses to take the ORS by the cup or bottle, give the solution using a medicine dropper, a syringe, a small teaspoon or frozen pops.
If your child vomits, stop foods and other fluids, but continue to give the ORS using a spoon.
Give 15 mL (1 tbsp.) every 10 min to 15 min until the vomiting stops.
Increase the amounts gradually until your child is able to drink the regular amounts.
If your child continues vomiting for longer than 4 to 6 hours, take your child to the hospital.
After 4 hours until 24 hours: Recovery stage
Keep giving your child the oral rehydration solution until diarrhea is less frequent.
Continue feeding your child their regular diet if they are not vomiting.
When vomiting decreases, it’s important to get your child to breastfeed as usual, drink formula or whole milk, or eat regular food in small, frequent feedings.
What should I avoid giving to my child?
Do not give your child sugary drinks like fruit juice or sweetened fruit drinks, carbonated drinks (pop/soda), sweetened tea, broth or rice water. These do not have the right amounts of water, salts and sugar and can make your child’s diarrhea worse.
If your child is having frequent diarrhea, make sure they are drinking an oral rehydration solution (not just plain water) and eating food. Bland foods with complex carbohydrates, lean meats, and fruits and vegetables are encouraged. Drinking only water may lead to low blood sugar or low sodium levels in your child’s blood.
Talk to your doctor before giving any over-the-counter medications to stop diarrhea.
When should I call the doctor?
Call your doctor or seek medical advice if your child:
has diarrhea and is less than 6 months of age.
has stomach pains that are getting worse.
has bloody or black stools.
vomits blood or bile.
is refusing to drink.
is still vomiting and unable to drink after 4 to 6 hours.
has diarrhea and a fever.
has signs of dehydration (see list above).
If your child vomits green bile, go to the emergency department right away.
Diarrhea lasting for more than 1 to 2 weeks is not considered acute diarrhea. Talk to your child’s doctor if this is the case.

Ear infections,"Ear infections
Middle ear infections are also called otitis media. They are very common, especially in children between 6 months and 3 years of age. They are usually not serious. Although not contagious, the viral illness that caused the infection can be. Most ear infections happen when a child has already had a cold for a few days.
What causes an ear infection?
Viruses or bacteria (germs) cause middle ear infections. The eustachian tube connects the middle ear with the back of the throat. Germs travel from the back of the throat when the eustachian tube is swollen from a cold, causing infection in the middle ear.
Who is at higher risk for ear infections?
Children less than 5 years old, because they have shorter eustachian tubes.
Children who attend daycare, because they tend to have more colds.
Children with allergies.
Children who are exposed to cigarette smoke. Smoke causes inflammation of the eustachian tube, making ear infections more likely.
Children who were not breastfed. Breast milk has antibodies that help fight infections.
Babies who are being bottle-fed, especially if they swallow milk while lying too flat. Milk can enter the eustachian tube and cause inflammation, which increases the risk of an ear infection. Children should be held upright while drinking a bottle. When they are old enough to hold their own bottle well, they should be taught to drink from a regular cup (not a “sippy cup”) and no longer given a bottle.
Children with cleft palates, as their eustachian tubes are often inflamed.
Children of First Nations and Inuit descent, though it’s not clear why.
Children with Down syndrome.
How do I know if my child has an ear infection?
Older children will usually complain of an earache. While younger children might not be able to say they have an earache, they may:
have an unexplained fever,
be fussy,
have trouble sleeping,
tug or pull at their ears, or
have trouble hearing quiet sounds.
Some children with an ear infection may also have fluid draining from the ear.
How is an ear infection diagnosed?
Doctors diagnose ear infections by looking at the ear drum (tympanic membrane) with a special light called an otoscope. They look for fluid in the middle ear, at the colour and position of the ear drum, and monitor the pressure in the middle ear. Common viral infections can make the ear drum look red, but antibiotics are not needed.
How is an ear infection treated?
If a child doesn’t have too much discomfort or a high fever, the doctor will likely wait 24 to 48 hours (1 to 2 days) to see if the ear infection gets better on its own. If the child does not improve or gets worse, contact the doctor again. 
You child’s doctor will prescribe antibiotics if:
your child is moderately to severely ill with a high fever (more than 39◦C),
your child has severe pain,
the condition has not improved for 48 hours, or
the ear canal has new fluid. 
For an uncomplicated ear infection, children between 6 months and 2 years usually take an antibiotic for 10 days. Children over 2 years of age will take an antibiotic for 5 days.
The doctor might suggest acetaminophen or ibuprofen to reduce the child’s pain. Only give ibuprofen if your child is drinking reasonably well. Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months old without first talking to your doctor.
Do not give over-the-counter medications (ones you can buy without a prescription) to babies and children under 6 years without first talking to your doctor. The only exceptions are medications used to treat fever, such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen.
Children usually feel better within 1 day of starting an antibiotic, but make sure to finish it. Your doctor might want to see your child again to be sure the infection has cleared up completely. Fluid can remain in the middle ear without inflammation for a few weeks.
When do children need tubes in their ears?
If your child has frequent ear infections, or if they have trouble hearing because of ongoing fluid in the middle ear, they may need a tube inserted through the eardrum and into the middle ear. The tube helps to keep air pressure normal on both sides of the ear drum and helps fluid drain from the middle ear.
Putting tubes in requires a brief operation by an ear, nose and throat surgeon. Children can usually go home the same day.
When should I call the doctor?
Call your doctor if you think your child has an ear infection AND:
has other serious medical problems,
seems ill,
vomits over and over,
is younger than 6 months old,
is older than 6 months old and has had a fever for more than 48 hours,
has redness and swelling behind the ear,
is very sleepy,
is very irritable,
has a skin rash,
isn’t hearing well or at all,
remains in a lot of pain despite at least one dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, or
still has an earache after 2 days of treatment with acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
How can I prevent my child from getting an ear infection?
Wash your child’s hands and your own often to keep germs away.
If possible, breastfeed your baby.
Avoid bottle-feeding your baby when they are lying down. Never put your baby to bed with a bottle.
Transition your baby from a bottle to a cup by 1 year of age.
Don’t smoke, and keep your child away from any second-hand smoke. Exposure to smoke can increase the risk of ear infections.
Ensure your child gets the pneumococcal vaccine (if they are at least 2 months of age, and have not already had this shot).
Ensure your child gets a flu shot every year. 
If your child has had many ear infections, try reducing the use of pacifiers (soothers). Using a pacifier may increase the risk of repeated ear infections.

What is epilepsy?
Epilepsy is a chronic disorder characterized by seizures. Seizures are abnormal bursts of electrical activity in the brain that results in a change in behaviour and/or function.
Epilepsy affects approximately 1 in 100 Canadian children and youth. Parents and caregivers should provide teachers and support staff with the information they need to create a safe and supportive learning environment for students with epilepsy.
What are epileptic seizures?
Not all seizures are the same. Signs and symptoms can include:
Temporary confusion
An extended blank stare
Uncontrollable jerking body movements
Loss of consciousness or awareness, sometimes with loss of bladder control
Most seizures last less than 5 minutes.
Certain situations can bring on a seizure in some people with epilepsy. Common triggers include not taking medication, tiredness, lack of sleep, stress, fever, and alcohol and drugs.
The best way to manage epilepsy is by taking medication and avoiding triggers.
How does epilepsy affect a child in school?
Students with epilepsy have the same range of abilities as those who do not live with epilepsy. When managed effectively, and with support and planning, students with epilepsy should be encouraged to participate in all school activities.
Social anxiety and stigma around epilepsy are common. This can often be more harmful to a student’s quality of life at school than the condition itself.
Managing epilepsy at school is important. Some families may worry that their child won’t have the proper support to deal with epilepsy at school. They wonder:
Will my child be excluded from activities?
Can my child go on field trips?
Is my child safe during the day? What happens if they have a seizure?
Most children and youth living with epilepsy will not have any other neurological conditions. Some students may need extra support at school due to difficulties with learning, behaviour and/or mobility.
Some children may occasionally be more sleepy than usual due to a recent medication adjustment. This should be temporary.
Is there support for students with epilepsy in schools?
It is very important that schools know when a student has epilepsy. School staff should also have access to reliable information on epilepsy. Your local epilepsy association can be a great source of information.
All students with epilepsy – no matter how independent they are – need the support of caring adults within the school setting. Seizures can happen quickly, so it’s important that school staff are educated, equipped and available to support students.
Support for students with epilepsy in schools varies across Canada. Resources and policies are different across the country, even among schools in the same city or the same school board. The level of teacher support will depend on your child’s age and stage of development, and the severity of their epilepsy.
What are the responsibilities of a parent or guardian and the school?
Supporting children and youth with epilepsy at school should be a shared responsibility between families, schools, and as needed, a health care provider. Older children should also be included in these responsibilities.
Although parents or guardians are responsible for the daily management decisions around their child’s epilepsy (e.g., medications and dosage), school staff should be equipped (and trained, as needed) to provide the student with reliable hands-on support and supervision. This can often be communicated through a seizure action plan.
Ongoing communication between the school and the student’s family is crucial, especially if there are changes to the student’s medical condition.
What is a seizure action plan?
Each school year, parents should develop a detailed seizure action plan for their child (or with their child if they are old enough to be involved in the process). This can be done in consultation with the child’s health care provider. The plan should be reviewed and updated regularly.
 A seizure action plan may include:
Roles and responsibilities of everyone involved in the student’s well-being.
Detailed information about the child’s epilepsy.
A daily epilepsy management plan.
What to do in case of a seizure.
Special instructions for the use of rescue medications, used in case of emergency.  
If, and when to call an ambulance.
The plan should be provided to all administrative staff, teachers, and anyone who is in contact with the student on a regular basis. It should also be available during bus rides, field trips, or sporting events.
What seizure first aid basics should school staff know?
School staff should:
place the student on their side, in recovery position,
time the seizure,
prevent injury (removing any unsafe objects),
never put anything in the student’s mouth,
call 911 if a seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes, and
refer to the student’s seizure action plan.
What should my child’s classmates know about epilepsy?
Children and youth may worry about answering questions from classmates. How to explain epilepsy to students depends on their age and level of understanding.
Having an information session can teach your child’s classmates about epilepsy and can help to create a supportive environment. Make sure to ask your child if they feel comfortable with an information session for their classroom. Some children and youth may want to be a part of this education about their condition, but others may not.
For educational materials or presentations for school staff or students, you can contact local support groups or epilepsy associations, school support nurses, or your child’s health care provider.

Febrile seizures,"Febrile seizures
What are febrile seizures?
Febrile seizures are convulsions caused by fever. They happen in 2 to 5% of children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years old. The older your child is when they have their first febrile seizure, the less likely they are to have more. If a family member (sibling, parent, aunt or uncle, grandparent) has had febrile seizures, your child may be more prone to them.
How will I know if my child is having a febrile seizure?
Often, the seizure is the first sign of your baby’s fever. It can be scary to see, but they aren’t as dangerous as they look.
Your child will have a fever higher than 38⁰C (100.4⁰F).
Their body will stiffen.
Their eyes will roll upward and their head and limbs (arms, legs) will be jerky.
They may briefly lose consciousness.
Most febrile seizures last between 30 seconds and 2 minutes and have no long-term effects.
What can I do?
Stay calm.
Place your child on a flat surface, on their side. Do not move them unless they are near something dangerous. Do not hold them own.
Wipe away any vomit or saliva outside the mouth, but do not put anything between their teeth.
When the seizure stops, keep your child on their side.
Allow your child to sleep after the seizure and wake them up gradually.
When should I call the doctor?
Call 911 if the seizure lasts longer than 3 minutes or if your baby is younger than 6 months old.
Visit your doctor for a physical exam to rule out any other problems within a few hours of any seizure, even a brief one.

Fever and temperature taking,"Fever and temperature taking
When your child is sick with an infection (viral or bacterial), it is common to also have a fever. Fever will not hurt your child. Usually, it goes away after 72 hours (3 days).
Babies younger than 6 months old should see a doctor when they have a fever. Babies younger than 3 months old should be seen urgently.
Older children can be treated at home, as long as they get enough liquids and seem well otherwise. However, they should see a doctor if their fever lasts for more than 48-72 hours.
There are several methods for taking your child’s temperature:
rectal (by the rectum or ‘bum’)
oral (by the mouth)
axillary (under the armpit)
tympanic (in the ear)
temporal artery (forehead)
Which method should I use?
The right method depends on your child’s age. It’s important that the measurement is accurate. The most accurate measurement by age is shown below. However, some parents or caregivers will first check for fever using an alternative method. Use this chart to help you decide which method to use:
Age Recommended method
Birth to 2 years Most accurate: Rectum 
Alternative: Armpit
Between 2 and 5 years Most accurate: Rectum 
Alternative: Ear, armpit
Older than 5 years Most accurate: Mouth 
Alternative: Ear, armpit
Temperature-taking tips
Do not use a mercury thermometer. If it breaks, you could be exposed to the toxic substance.
A digital thermometer can be used for both rectal and oral temperature taking. It’s made of unbreakable plastic, is easy to read, easy to clean, and measures temperature quickly.
Do not use the same thermometer for rectal and oral temperature taking.
A non-contact infrared thermometer can display a reading quickly and reduce the risk of spreading disease. But head coverings, sweat, environment (direct sunlight, humidity, cold air, etc.), and positioning on forehead may influence the measurement.
Fever strips are not recommended because they do not give accurate readings.
Touching your child's skin (e.g., forehead) is not a reliable way to check for fever. If you suspect a fever, confirm it by using one of the methods above.
To get an accurate reading of your child’s temperature, you will need to make sure it’s done right. Here’s how:
Rectum
This is the most reliable way to measure body temperature. Only use a rectal thermometer if you are comfortable doing so and if a health care provider has shown you how to do it safely.
Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse.
Cover the silver tip with petroleum jelly (such as Vaseline).
Place your baby on their back with their knees bent.
Gently insert the thermometer in the rectum, about 2.5 cm (1 inch), holding it in place with your fingers.
When ready, remove the thermometer and read the temperature.
Clean the thermometer.
Mouth
The oral method is not recommended for children younger than 5 years old because it is hard for them to hold the thermometer under their tongue for long enough.
Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse.
Carefully place the tip of the thermometer under your child’s tongue.
With your child’s mouth closed, leave the thermometer in place for about 1 minute, until you hear the beep.
Remove the thermometer and read the temperature.
Clean the thermometer.
Armpit
The armpit (axillary) method is usually used to check for fever in newborns and young children, but it’s not as accurate as a rectal temperature. If an axillary temperature does not show a fever but your child feels warm and seems unwell, take a rectal measurement.
Use a rectal or oral thermometer.
Clean the thermometer with cool, soapy water and rinse.
Place the tip of the thermometer in the centre of your child’s armpit.
Make sure your child’s arm is tucked snugly against their body.
When ready, remove the thermometer and read the temperature.
Clean the thermometer.
Ear
Though quick to use, the ear (tympanic) method can give temperature readings that are too low, even when the manufacturer’s directions are followed. It is not as reliable or accurate as rectal temperature taking. If a tympanic temperature does not show a fever but your child feels warm and seems unwell, take a rectal measurement.
Use a clean probe tip each time, and follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully.
Gently tug on the ear, pulling it back. This will help straighten the ear canal, and make a clear path inside the ear to the eardrum.
Gently insert the thermometer until the ear canal is fully sealed off.
When ready, remove the thermometer and read the temperature.
What is a normal temperature?
The following chart lists normal temperatures. The range varies and depends on the way you took your child’s temperature. Any temperature above this range is considered a fever.
Method Normal temperature range
Rectum 36.6°C to 37.9°C (97.9°F to 100.2°F)
Mouth 35.5°C to 37.5°C (95.9°F to 99.5°F)
Armpit 36.5°C to 37.5°C (97.8°F to 99.5°F)
Ear 35.8°C to 37.9°C (96.4°F to 100.2°F)
The degree (height) of a fever does not tell you how serious your child’s illness is—how your child looks and acts is usually a better sign. A child with a mild infection can have a high fever, while a child with a severe infection might have no fever at all. 
What can I do if my child has a fever?
Keep your child comfortable, and offer plenty of fluids.
Remove extra blankets and clothing so heat can leave their body and help lower the body temperature. But don’t take off all your child’s clothes because they may become too cold and start shivering, which makes more body heat and will cause their temperature to rise again.
What about medications?
Medications are not always needed to reduce a child’s temperature. They can be used to relieve any aches and pains, and to make your child more comfortable.
Medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol or Tempra) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) do not treat the underlying cause of the fever but can help temporarily lower a temperature. Sometimes a fever continues even after giving medication. That’s ok.
Unless your doctor says otherwise, you can give the dose recommended on the medication package. The correct dose should be based on your child’s body weight. Never exceed the recommended dose.
Ibuprofen should only be given if your child is drinking reasonably well. Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months without first talking to your doctor or health care provider.
Acetaminophen and ibuprofen have different doses and different lengths of time between doses. They are safe to take at the same time, but because the dose and time are different, it is important to keep track when using both for your child.
Do not use aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)] to treat a child’s fever. If the fever is due to chickenpox, influenza or certain other viral infections, taking aspirin can increase the risk of Reye’s syndrome. This is a very serious condition that can damage the liver and brain.
Contact your health care provider if your child
has a fever and is less than 6 months old.
has a fever for more than 48-72 hours. 
is excessively cranky, fussy or irritable.
is excessively sleepy, lethargic or does not respond.
is persistently wheezing or coughing.
has a fever combined with a rash or any other signs of illness that worry you.

Fifth disease (Erythema Infectiosum),"Fifth disease (Erythema Infectiosum)
Fifth disease is sometimes called “slapped cheek” syndrome because of the red rash it causes. It is a common infection of the airway and lungs. Parvovirus B19 causes fifth disease. It’s most common in late winter to early spring.
What are the symptoms of fifth disease?
There may be no symptoms or only mild symptoms. 
Fifth disease sometimes begins with a low-grade fever (102°F (38.9°C)), headache, and mild cold-like symptoms (a stuffy or runny nose). Symptoms may also include an upset stomach (nausea and diarrhea).
It starts as a very red rash on the cheeks that looks like the face has been slapped.
After 1 to 4 days, a red, lace-like rash appears, first on the torso and arms, and then spreads to the rest of the body.
The rash may last from 1 to 3 weeks. During that time, the rash may come and go. It can be worse with changes in temperature, exposure to sun, and exercise.
How does fifth disease spread?
This virus spreads the same as a cold virus:
By touching the hands of someone who has the infection and then putting your hands in your mouth.
By touching an object (such as a toy or a bottle) that has been touched by someone who has the infection and then putting your hands in your mouth.
By coming in contact with the virus in the air, after an infected person has coughed or sneezed.
The virus is most contagious a few days before the rash starts. Once the rash appears, your child can no longer pass it to anyone else.
This virus can spread from a pregnant woman to her unborn child.
Can fifth disease be dangerous?
Fifth disease is usually very mild. Your child may not even feel sick. It’s usually more severe in adults. Most people who had fifth disease as a child will not get it again.
If a child with certain forms of chronic anemia (such as sickle cell) gets fifth disease, their condition may get worse.
Fifth disease can be dangerous to people who are having chemotherapy treatment.
What should I do if I’m pregnant and not immune to fifth disease? 
Pregnant women who are not immune usually do not have serious complications after being exposed to others with fifth disease. In most cases, these babies will not have any problems. However, sometimes a baby will develop severe anemia.
If you’re pregnant and develop a rash or have sore joints and have been exposed to someone with fifth disease (or to anyone with an unusual rash), call your health care professional.
What can parents do?
There is no vaccine to prevent the infection and no medication to treat it.
The best way to prevent the spread of any infection is to wash your hands often.
Children can continue to attend child care or school if they feel well enough to take part in the activities.
When should I call the doctor?
If your child becomes ill with fifth disease and you are pregnant.
If your child’s fever does not get better in 2-3 days, or they complain of ear pain or a sore neck.

Giardia,"Giardia
Giardia is a tiny parasite (an organism that feeds off of another to survive) that can cause a bowel infection. It’s found in soil, food, or water that has been contaminated with feces (poop) from infected humans or animals. When a person gets sick, the infection is called giardiasis, or ‘beaver fever’.
What are the symptoms?
Giardia affects children differently. Some have no symptoms, while others may have:
watery diarrhea or mushy bowel movements (which may have a very bad smell),
stomach cramps or nausea,
severe gas,
loss of appetite,
dehydration, and/or
weight loss.
The symptoms can last from 2 to 6 weeks.
How does it spread?
Giardia is spread when someone swallows the parasite. For example:
A child swallows water while swimming or playing where Giardia may live, especially in natural outdoor water sources such as lakes, rivers, springs, ponds, and streams.
Germs from a dirty diaper, the toilet flush handle or the bathroom door handle can get on a person’s hands and spread into someone’s mouth.
From eating food containing Giardia that hasn't been washed or cooked properly.
How do you prevent Giardia?
Wash your hands with soap and water after changing a diaper, helping your child to go to the toilet or going to the toilet yourself.
Wash your hands before preparing and eating food.
Teach your child not to drink the water they swim in.
How do you treat it?
The Giardia parasite may be in a child’s stool and not cause illness. If your child has no symptoms, treatment is not necessary.
If your child has symptoms, your doctor will ask you to provide a stool sample. It can be hard to detect Giardia so you may have to provide more than one sample.
If your child has Giardia, your doctor will prescribe a medication. Your child should take all of the medicine prescribed by your doctor. If they stop taking it before the illness is gone, the infection can come back.
What can parents do?
Contact your doctor if you think your child has a Giardia infection. See below for more details.
Provide the stool samples on different days to confirm the diagnosis.
Continue to offer breast milk, formula or regular foods and liquids in small, frequent feedings, even if your child is vomiting.
If your doctor confirms that your child has Giardia, keep him home from child care until the diarrhea has stopped.
Make sure that everyone in your house is washing their hands with soap and water after changing a diaper and using the toilet, and before preparing and eating food.
Clean and disinfect shared toys.
When should I call a doctor?
See your doctor as soon as possible if your child:
is vomiting and showing any sign of dehydration, such as
no tears when crying,
dry skin, mouth and tongue,
fewer than 4 wet diapers in 24 hours,
has a fever and is less than 6 months old or has had a fever for more than 72 hours (3 days),
is breathing rapidly,
has grayish skin,
has severe belly pain,
has severe diarrhea, or
has bloody or black stools.

"Hand, foot and mouth disease","Hand, foot and mouth disease
What is hand, foot and mouth disease?
Hand, foot and mouth disease is an infection caused by the Coxsackie virus. Though it mostly affects young children, it can occur at any age. Outbreaks are most common in the summer and fall.
What are the symptoms?
Hand, foot and mouth disease is usually not a severe illness. It can cause:
fever,
small, painful ulcers in the mouth,
a skin rash that looks like red spots, often with small blisters on top, that appear on the hands (palms) and feet (soles), buttocks and sometimes other places on the body,
headache,
sore throat,
loss of appetite,
lack of energy,
vomiting and/or diarrhea.
How does hand, foot and mouth disease spread?
Hand, foot and mouth disease is most contagious during the first week of illness. It spreads through contact with an infected person’s saliva or stool. Germs can get on a person’s hands or other objects and then spread into someone’s mouth, causing infection. The virus can be found in a person’s stool for up to 4 weeks after the start of the illness.
Hand, foot and mouth disease is not spread by animals.
Handwashing is the best way to prevent the spread of infection.
What can parents do?
There is no treatment for the infection. Antibiotics won’t help it go away faster. It can last for 7 to 10 days.
Keep your child comfortable and offer plenty of food and liquids. If your child has sores in their mouth, offer cold, bland liquids such as milk or water. Do not give fruit juice because it will sting.
Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce the discomfort caused by mouth sores. Sometimes the pain can be so severe that your doctor will have to provide a prescription pain reliever.
Make sure everyone in your house washes their hands with soap and water after changing a diaper, blowing their nose (or a child’s nose), and using the toilet, and before preparing and eating food.
Do not pop the blisters; they will heal on their own.
Although hand, foot and mouth disease is most contagious in the early stage, the virus can be transmitted from blisters and secretions (such as saliva, sputum or nasal mucus). Children should stay home from school and child care if they have symptoms.
Wash toys and surfaces in your home regularly.
Call your doctor if your child:
Is vomiting and showing any sign of dehydration, such as:
no tears when crying.
dry skin, mouth and tongue.
less or no urine (fewer than 4 wet diapers in 24 hours).
refusing food and/or fluids for 4-8 hours because of mouth sores.
Is breathing rapidly.
Has a severe sore throat.
Has a severe headache, especially with vomiting, confusion or unusual sleepiness.

Head lice,"Head lice
Head lice are tiny insects that live on the scalp, where they lay eggs. Head lice do not spread disease. It’s not your fault if you or your child has head lice.
Having head lice does not mean you are not clean.
What do head lice look like?
Lice have 3 stages – the egg (nit), the nymph and the adult.
Nits are whitish-grey, tan or yellow ovals, about the size of a grain of sand. They stick to the hair close to the scalp and can look like dandruff. Nits hatch into nymphs in 9 to 10 days.
Nymphs are baby lice. They look like adult lice but smaller.
Adult lice are hard to see since they are about the size of a sesame seed. Adult lice can live for up to 30 days on a person’s head, but they die within 2 days away from the scalp. 
How do they spread?
Head lice spread easily, especially where people are in close contact. They are very common among school-aged children or children in child care.
Head lice spread through direct hair-to-hair contact or indirectly by sharing hats, combs, hairbrushes and headphones.
Head lice don’t fly or hop, but crawl very quickly.
The head lice that live on people are different from the kind that live on cats or dogs. People cannot get head lice from animals.
How do you know you have head lice?
One of the first signs of head lice is an itchy scalp, but it’s possible to have head lice without any symptoms. Most itchy scalps are not from head lice. If your child has an itchy scalp or was exposed to head lice, check their hair right away. Check again once a week for 2 weeks in case you missed them.
How do I check for head lice?
Look carefully through the hair for live lice and nits. If you only find nits, your child may not have head lice. Usually children have no more than 10 to 20 live lice.
Because lice are so small, good lighting is important. A magnifying glass may help.
Head lice move fast and are hard to see. You may just see movement rather than the actual lice. Lice are usually found very close to the scalp, at the bottom of the neck and behind the ears.
To look for nits, part hair in small sections, moving from one side of the head to the other. Look close to the scalp. If you only find nits and no lice, check again every day for 1 week to make sure that you did not miss any live lice.
How can I treat head lice?
Do not treat anyone with a head lice product unless you find live lice in their hair. If someone in the house has lice, check all family members.
Head lice can be treated in a variety of ways:
Insecticides
Insecticides are chemicals that kill insects. In Canada, 2 insecticides are approved to treat head lice:
pyrethrin (found in R&C shampoo + conditioner)
permethrin (Nix creme rinse or Kwellada-P creme rinse)
Pyrethrin and permethrin are safe when used on humans over 2 months old. You do not need a prescription. Over time, head lice have become resistant to some of the chemicals used to kill them, so some products may be less effective than they used to be. But they are still worth trying.
How to apply insecticides:
Follow package directions carefully.
Don’t leave the shampoo or rinse in the hair longer than directed.
Rinse hair with cool water after the treatment. It’s best to rinse over a sink, not in the bath or shower, so that other body parts don’t come in contact with the product.
Repeat the treatment after 7 to 10 days, in case new lice hatched from the nits.
These treatments can sometimes make the scalp itchy or can leave a mild burning feeling. If your child is scratching after treatment, it does not necessarily mean the lice are back.
Non-insecticides
Isopropyl myristate/cyclomethicone (Resultz) is approved for use in Canada, but it should only be used in children 4 years of age and older. It dehydrates the lice and they die. Apply to a dry scalp and rinse with warm water after 10 minutes. Repeat after 1 week.
Silicone oil dimeticone (NYDA) is effective against live lice, nymphs and nits. It is not recommended for children under 2 years old. A second treatment is recommended after 8 to 10 days.
Benzyl alcohol lotion 5% (Ulesfia) is effective against live lice, but a second treatment is recommended after 9 days.
These products are usually more expensive than insecticides. It is not known for sure whether they work better.
Other treatments
Some people suggest home remedies such as mayonnaise, petroleum jelly, olive oil, vinegar or margarine. Although these products may make it hard for lice to breathe, they probably won’t kill them.
There is little evidence that wet combing (removing lice by combing wet hair with a fine-tooth comb) works all on its own.
There is no evidence that products such as tea tree oil or aromatherapy work to treat head lice.
Ivermectin is a drug that can be taken by mouth or used as a cream, but it is not approved for use in Canada.
Never use gasoline or kerosene. These products can be extremely dangerous.
Do I need to disinfect the house if someone has head lice?
Because head lice don’t live long off the scalp, there is no need for extra cleaning.
However, you do need to get rid of lice or nits from items that touch the head such as hats, pillowcases, combs and brushes:
Wash items in hot water and dry them in a hot dryer for at least 15 min; or
Store the items in an airtight plastic bag for 2 weeks. Use a Ziploc-type bag that is airtight. A regular shopping bag often has little holes.
Should children with head lice stay home from school?
Children with head lice should be treated and then attend school or child care as usual. ‘No-nit’ policies that keep children with head lice or nits after treatment away from school are not necessary because:
Head lice are common among young children. Many days of school would be missed if children had to stay home.
People are often wrong when they think a child has head lice. It would be unfortunate to see children missing school when they don’t really have lice.
Making children stay at home will not get rid of head lice. Often, other children in the class have lice but don’t have any symptoms. Without treatment, they will continue to spread lice.
Head lice don’t spread disease. They are a nuisance and unpleasant, but they are not dangerous.
How to prevent head lice?
Teach your child to avoid head-to-head contact. Children should not share combs, hairbrushes, tuques, hats or hair accessories.

Hepatitis C in pregnancy,"Hepatitis C in pregnancy
Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by a virus that is transmitted through contact with the blood of an infected person.
How else can hepatitis C spread?
Hepatitis C can also spread from using intravenous drugs (drugs injected with a needle) or from tattoos done with needles and paints that have not been properly sterilized (cleaned). Very rarely, hepatitis C can come from having unprotected sex with an infected person.
How do children get hepatitis C?
About 1 in 20 children born to a mother with chronic hepatitis C become will become infected during pregnancy or delivery. Among street-involved youth, injection drug use is the main risk factor. Before 1991, children sometimes got hepatitis C from blood transfusions. This almost never happens now because blood is screened.
What are the symptoms?
Most people have no symptoms. Some people will have nausea and jaundice (yellow skin and eyes) when they are first infected.
What are the long term effects of hepatitis C?
Sometimes the body can clear the virus on its own, but usually the virus stays in the liver.
People who have the virus in their liver for more than 6 months are known as hepatitis C carriers. Most carriers live for many years without major health problems, but some develop severe liver damage (cirrhosis) or cancer of the liver. These complications usually happen many years after a person first gets infected with hepatitis C.
I am pregnant. Should I be tested for hepatitis C?
Doctors typically only do a blood test for hepatitis C for patients who are at risk. If you have ever used intravenous drugs, even just once, you should ask to be tested. Testing for hepatitis C may eventually become a routine test in all pregnancies.
What will happen if I have hepatitis C?
There is no need to do a Caesarian section just because you have hepatitis C.
If you have hepatitis C, you should be referred to specialists who deal with this infection. Treatments exist, but the need for and timing of treatment can be assessed after your baby is born.
Should my baby be tested for hepatitis C?
Your baby will need to be tested for hepatitis C only if you test positive. Sometimes testing is done as early as 2 months of age, but it is not totally accurate at this age. It will need to be done again at 18 months of age.
How can I protect my baby from getting hepatitis C?
If you have hepatitis C, there is about a 1 in 20 chance that you will pass it to your baby. The risk is higher if you also have HIV and are not being treated. Unfortunately, there is no way to fully eliminate the risk of spread of hepatitis C to your baby.
Can I breastfeed if I have hepatitis C?
Studies have shown that the chance of passing hepatitis C to your baby from breastfeeding is very low. You can breastfeed if you have hepatitis C, unless you also have HIV.
However, if you have hepatitis C and experience a flare-up of the illness with jaundice after your baby is born, you should not breastfeed. If your nipples are cracked or bleeding, you should also stop breastfeeding and pump and discard your milk until your nipples have healed.   
What happens if my child has hepatitis C?
Approximately 1 in 5 children with hepatitis C clear the virus on their own. The others become carriers. Even though the virus stays in the liver of children who are carriers, most stay healthy.
Children who are hepatitis C carriers will see their doctors regularly and have blood tests. Treatment is usually not required for many years. However, as the evidence for use of new medications in children becomes available, it is likely that many children with chronic infection will be treated.

Impetigo,"Impetigo
What is impetigo?
Impetigo is a common childhood skin infection that is usually caused by bacteria called Group A Streptococcus (strep) or Staphylococcus aureus (staph). Infection occurs when the bacteria get into scrapes and insect bites.
Having impetigo does not mean someone is not clean. It often affects preschool and school-aged children, especially those whose skin has already been irritated or who have other skin problems like eczema or poison ivy.
What does impetigo look like?
Impetigo usually appears around the mouth, nose or on skin that isn't covered by clothes. The rash can start as a cluster of red bumps or blisters. Eventually the blisters may ooze or be covered with a honey-coloured crust. Many germs live under this crust.
Sometimes the infection can become serious. If this happens, your child may have fever, pain, swelling, and may feel weak.
How is it passed?
Direct contact: Impetigo can spread when someone touches an impetigo rash.
Indirect contact: The germs can get on bed sheets, towels or clothing that have been in contact with someone’s skin. Then another person can pick up the germs from touching those objects.
How is it diagnosed?
Your doctor can usually diagnose impetigo by looking at it. They may use a skin swab to confirm the type of bacteria causing the infection.
How is it treated?
Your doctor will prescribe antibiotics. These will be taken orally (by the mouth) or spread on the skin as an ointment (cream). If you think your child has impetigo, contact your doctor.
If your child has impetigo:
Keep the sores covered with a dressing (light gauze).
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water, especially after touching infected skin.
Don’t share face cloths or towels among family members.
Keep your child home from child care or school until he has taken the antibiotic for at least one full day.
Make sure your child takes all the medication prescribed by your doctor, even if you don’t see the rash or any sign of infection anymore.

Influenza in children,"Influenza in children
Influenza (or “flu”) is a respiratory infection caused by influenza virus. Influenza outbreaks happen every year, usually between November and April. Because influenza viruses change – often from year to year – people don’t stay immune for very long. That’s why people can catch the flu more than once. The term “seasonal flu” is used for the influenza viruses that spread every year.
How does influenza spread?
Influenza viruses are found in the nose and throat. Children can catch influenza from siblings, parents, other family members, playmates or caregivers.
Germs usually spread in one of 3 ways:
Direct contact —such as kissing, touching or holding hands—with an infected person. If you have a virus, you will have germs in your nose, mouth, eyes or on your skin. By touching other people, you can pass on the virus. 
Indirect contact means touching something—a toy, doorknob or a used tissue—that has been touched by an infected person and now has germs on it. Some germs, like the ones that cause colds and diarrhea, can stay on surfaces for many hours. 
Through the air when a person coughs or sneezes. Droplets from the cough or sneeze may reach another person’s nose or mouth.
How do I know if my child has influenza?
The flu strikes more quickly than a cold, and makes people feel worse. Children with colds usually have energy to play and keep up their daily routines. Children with influenza are usually in bed.
Typical influenza symptoms include:
sudden fever,
chills and shakes,
headache,
muscle aches,
extreme fatigue,
dry cough,
sore throat, and
loss of appetite.
Children with the flu may have many of the same symptoms as adults, but there can be differences:
Newborns and babies may have a high fever that can’t be explained, and no other signs of sickness.
Young children usually have temperatures over 39.5°C and may have febrile seizures (convulsions). 
Upset stomach and pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are common in younger children. Earaches and red eyes are also common. 
In some cases, muscle inflammation can lead to severe leg or back pain. 
Can the flu cause any other complications?
Most healthy people recover from the flu without any serious problems. Fever and muscle aches usually last only 2 to 4 days, but cough and tiredness can continue for 1 to 2 weeks or more.
In young children, flu can cause croup (an infection of the throat and vocal cords causing hoarseness, barking cough, noisy breathing), pneumonia (lung infection) and bronchiolitis (infection of the tiny airways that lead to the lungs causing wheezing and difficulty breathing).
Influenza can weaken the immune system, leading to bacterial infections of the ear (otitis), lung (pneumonia) or sinuses (sinusitis).
Influenza is more severe in children under 2 years of age and in children with certain chronic conditions such as heart, lung or neurological problems.
In rare cases, influenza can affect the brain or heart.
What can I do if my child has influenza?
Keep your child as comfortable as possible. Offer plenty of fluids and small, nutritious meals. 
If they have a fever, dress them in lightweight clothing and keep the room temperature around 20°C. 
To ease pain, aches or a fever with a temperature greater than 38.5°C, use acetaminophen. Ibuprofen may be used for children over 6 months old. Unless your doctor says otherwise, give the dose recommended on the package every 4-6 hours until the child’s temperature comes down. Don’t give acetylsalicylic acid (ASA [eg, Aspirin])—or any medicine containing it—to children and teenagers with colds because it can lead to brain and liver damage (Reye syndrome).
Don’t give over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines to children younger than 6 years old unless your doctor prescribes them.
Gargling with warm water will ease a sore throat. For children 3 years of age or older who can safely suck on hard candy without choking can use sugarless hard candy or lozenges containing honey, herbs or pectin. Throat lozenges containing medications that numb the throat (dyclonine, benzocaine, hexylresorcinol, menthol and phenol) should not be used by young children because they can make it hard for them to swallow.
Antiviral medications
If your child has lung or heart disease, an illness that affects the immune system or some other chronic condition that requires regular medical attention and you think your child may have influenza, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug. These drugs may also be prescribed for healthy people with severe influenza. They should be taken within 48 hours of the first symptoms to be most effective.
When should I call my doctor?
Call your doctor or take your baby to an emergency department if your baby is under 3 months of age and:
is having trouble breathing,
is not eating or is vomiting, or 
has a fever (rectal temperature of 38.5°C or higher).
Call your doctor or take your child to an emergency department if your child is:
breathing rapidly or seems to be working hard to breathe,
having chest pain, or is coughing up bloody sputum (phlegm or saliva), 
coughing so bad that they are choking or vomiting,
drinking very little fluid and have not urinated (peed) at least every 6 hours when awake, 
vomiting for more than 4 hours, or has severe diarrhea, 
much sleepier than usual, doesn’t want to feed or play, or is very fussy and cannot be comforted,
not feeling better after 5 days and still has a fever, or was feeling better and suddenly develops a new fever, or showing signs of the flu and has a serious chronic illness. 
Take your child immediately to a hospital emergency department or call 911 if your child:
has severe trouble breathing or blue lips,
is limp or unable to move, 
is hard to wake up or does not respond, 
has a stiff neck, 
seems confused, or 
has a seizure (convulsion). 
How can I prevent the spread of influenza? 
Influenza can be prevented through immunization. Children over 6 months old should get a flu shot each year. 
If there are children younger than 5 years old or someone with a serious chronic condition in your home, everyone living in the house should get a flu shot. This is especially important if there are children under 6 months old in the home, since babies this age can’t get the flu shot themselves and could become infected if a family member gets the flu.  
Handwashing is the most important way to reduce the spread of viruses.
Keep babies under 3 months old away from people who are sick, if possible.
Teach your children to cover their nose and mouth with tissues when they sneeze or cough, or to cough into their upper sleeve or elbow. 
Avoid sharing toys that young children place in their mouths until the toys have been cleaned. 
Avoid sharing cups, utensils or towels until they have been washed.
If your child attends daycare, tell the caregiver about any symptoms and ask if your child should stay home that day.
Make sure your child receives all of the recommended vaccines. They will help prevent some of the complications, such as bacterial infections of the ears or lungs.

Lyme disease,"Lyme disease
Lyme disease is an infection caused by bacteria that are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged deer tick. Ticks become infected by feeding on infected mice, other rodents, small mammals and birds. White-tailed deer can transport the attached ticks to new areas.
In Canada, Lyme disease is on the increase. It is most common in parts of British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. But, it may be spreading to other provinces.
Lyme disease is most common in children aged 5 to 9 years and adults aged 55 to 59 years. 
What does a deer tick look like?
A tick’s size and colour depends on the stage of development and how long the tick has been feeding. The picture shows deer ticks at different stages.
How can I protect my child from deer ticks?
Ticks cannot jump or fly. They climb tall grasses or shrubs and wait for potential hosts to brush against them.
If you live, hike or camp in rural or wooded areas where you may be exposed to ticks, especially from late spring to early fall, you should take precautions. Here is what you can do to help prevent contact with infected ticks:
In wooded areas and parks, stay on paths to avoid areas where ticks are most common.
Ensure you and your children are dressed in long, loose-fitting clothes that cover the arms and legs, a hat and closed shoes (not sandals). Tucking shirts into pants and pants into socks are extra precautions.
Use insect repellents containing DEET or icaridin as directed on the label. Reapply as suggested.
Practice daily “full body” checks for ticks, and remove any attached ticks.
Shower or bathe within a few hours of being outdoors.
Keep gardens tidy and landscaped if you live near a wooded area.
Currently, there is no vaccine to prevent Lyme disease in humans.
How do I remove a tick from my child?
If you find a tick attached to your child, remove it as soon as possible. Ticks can stay attached and feed for five or more days. Removing a tick within 24 to 36 hours of it starting to feed is likely to prevent Lyme disease.
Use fine-tipped tweezers to grasp the tick’s mouth-part area (not the body) close to the skin surface (Figure A).
Pull upward with steady, even pressure (Figure B).
Don’t twist or jerk the tick; this can cause the mouth-parts to break off and stay in the skin. If this happens, remove the mouth-parts with tweezers. If you can’t, leave it alone and let the skin heal.
When possible, disinfect the bite area after removal (with an antiseptic like rubbing alcohol).

What are the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease?
Lyme disease has three stages. Not everyone experiences all symptoms. Children treated with antibiotics in the early stage almost never develop late stages of the disease.
Early stage:
In about 70 per cent of children with early Lyme disease: A circular or oval expanding pink or red rash (which often looks like a bull’s eye) called erythema migrans at the site of a recent tick bite.  The rash can be more than 5 cm (2 inches) across, and almost always develops from 3 to 30 days after a tick bite. Unlike skin infections, it is usually painless.
Fever, general discomfort, headache, mild neck stiffness, muscle and/or joint pain may be present with or without the rash.
Blood tests for Lyme disease should not be done in the early stages, because they are usually negative. If someone has been in area with known Lyme disease and develops a rash that is thought to possibly be erythema migrans, they should be treated with antibiotics that work for Lyme disease. A person who has no rash but has other possible signs or symptoms of Lyme disease after a tick bite should see a doctor.
Second stage, when the bacteria spread in the body:
Multiple erythema migrans rashes may appear several weeks after the tick bite.
Facial paralysis (Bell’s palsy) may appear as weakness in the muscles of one side of the face (sometimes both sides), often noticed as an uneven smile.
Meningitis may appear with fever, headache, stiff or sore neck.
Heart disease is rare, especially in children.
Late stage:
Arthritis (swelling, warmth) affecting knees or larger joints weeks to months after a tick bite. Usually only one joint is affected. Swelling may develop over days or may come and go over weeks to months.
Neurological disease is uncommon in children.
Post-Lyme disease persistent symptoms:
Som people can still have fatigue or other symptoms even after treatment. 
Blood tests for Lyme disease
If your doctor recommends a blood test for Lyme disease, it should be done through a licenced public health laboratory in Canada. Tests offered by private, non-licenced laboratories are not reliable
When should I call a doctor?
If you find an engorged tick on your child or if it has been attached for more than 36 hours, talk to your doctor or local health authorities. In areas with a lot of Lyme disease, they may recommend a single dose of an antibiotic to prevent Lyme disease from starting.
Call the doctor right away if your child develops signs or symptoms of Lyme disease or feels unwell after a tick bite. All stages of Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics can cure Lyme disease.

Molluscum contagiosum,"Molluscum contagiosum
Molluscum contagiosum is a common, mild skin disease caused by a pox virus. Although it can happen at any age, it is most common in children 1 to 10 years of age.
What are the symptoms?
Tiny “pinpoints” appear on the skin 1 to 6 months after exposure to the virus. These turn into pinkish-white bumps that are smooth and shiny, have a dip in the middle and have a milky-white cheesy-like material inside. Bumps can appear anywhere on your child’s body. Most children get 1 to 20 bumps, but some can have hundreds. They may become itchy, sore, red, and/or swollen.
How does it spread?
Molluscum contagiosum doesn’t spread easily from person to person and outbreaks are rare. It can spread by direct (skin-to-skin) contact with bumps, or indirect contact (e.g., bedding contaminated with material from the bumps, sharing of towels). Scratching can spread the infection from one part of the body to another.
Once the bumps are gone, the virus is gone and you cannot spread it to others.
Is molluscum contagiosum serious?
Molluscum is harmless and will disappear without treatment. Each bump usually lasts about 2 months but children may continue to get new bumps for months or even years. If the bumps are bothering your child, a doctor can prescribe a cream or, if there are not too many bumps, remove them by scraping or freezing.
What do I do if my child has molluscum contagiosum?
Bring them to the doctor to confirm that it is molluscum contagiosum.
Wash your hands often. This is important to prevent spreading the infection.
Encourage your child not to scratch or pick at the bumps.
Make sure your child doesn’t share towels, clothing, or other personal belongings with others.
Should I cover the bumps?
No. Covering is not necessary. When your child is swimming or doing contact activities, you can cover bumps that aren’t covered by clothing with a waterproof bandage. Change the bandage daily or when dirty. Keeping bumps tightly covered for long periods can lead to bacterial infections and scarring. If your child picks at the bumps, cover them with a loose gauze dressing.
Can my child go to child care or school?
Yes. Once your child’s doctor confirms that it is molluscum, your child can continue to attend child care and/or school. Remind them to wash their hands often.

Pinkeye (Conjunctivitis),"Pinkeye (Conjunctivitis)
What is pinkeye?
Pinkeye (conjunctivitis) is an infection that affects the covering of the eyeball and the inside of the eyelid. While it is usually caused by a virus, it can also be caused by bacteria.
What are the symptoms?
Children with pinkeye will complain of a scratchy feeling in their eyes.
There may be lots of tearing.
The whites of the eyes are pink or red. The eyelid may also be slightly swollen.
Pus or discharge from the eyes can make the eyelids sticky during sleep, and can collect in the corners of the eyes when awake.
How does pinkeye spread?
Pinkeye spreads easily by:
Direct contact: when a child with pinkeye touches the discharge from their eye and then touches another child.
Indirect contact: when an object that is contaminated with the virus, such as a tissue, is touched or touches another person’s eyes.
Droplet: when pinkeye is caused by a common cold, droplets from a sneeze or cough can also spread it. 
How is pinkeye treated?
The treatment may involve antibiotic eye drops or ointment and will depend on the type of pinkeye.
Purulent pinkeye, with a pink or red eyeball, white or yellow discharge, sticky or red eyelids and eye discomfort, is usually caused by bacteria. It is treated with antibiotics (eye drops or ointment), which stop the illness from spreading to others. 
Non-purulent pinkeye, where the eyeball is pink or red but the discharge is clear or watery, has only mild or no discomfort. It is usually caused by a virus or other irritant (such as an allergy or exposure to a chemical like the chlorine in a pool). An antibiotic drop will not work for this type of pinkeye.
When should I see the doctor?
Talk to your doctor:
If your baby has purulent eye discharge and is less than 3 months old. 
If you think your child has pinkeye. It is not easy to know if a bacteria or a virus has caused the infection. Your doctor will know if your child needs an antibiotic or other treatment.
If your child seems unwell and has a fever, rash or eye pain, or if the pinkeye seems to keep coming back. Some more serious illnesses may look like pink eye at first.
How can I prevent the spread of pinkeye?
Wipe tears or discharge from your child’s eye from the inside out and in one direction only. Use a clean part of the cloth each time. 
Wash your hands and your child’s hands very carefully after touching or wiping your child’s eyes.
Don’t share towels or washcloths because they could spread the illness.
If your child has viral pinkeye, they can return to child care once they have seen a doctor. If your child has bacterial pinkeye and is taking antibiotics, they should stay home from child care or school until they’ve had the antibiotics for 24 hours.

Pinworms,"Pinworms
What are pinworms?
Pinworms are tiny, white, thread-like worms that live in the rectum. The worms crawl out of the anus (bum) at night and lay their eggs on nearby skin. Pinworms can be uncomfortable but they do not cause disease. People who have pinworms aren’t dirty.  Children can get pinworms no matter how often they take a bath.
How common are pinworms?
They are very common in children and spread easily among children in child care. 
How do pinworms spread?
Directly: An infected person who scratches the itchy area can get pinworm eggs on the fingers or under the fingernails. If that person touches another person’s mouth, they will spread pinworms.
Indirectly: Eggs can get from an infected person onto objects, such as toys, toilet seats or baths, clothes or bedding. By sharing these objects, other people can pick up the eggs on their hands and then put them into their mouth.
Eggs can live for up to 2 weeks outside the body, on clothing, bedding or other objects.
What are the symptoms?
Usually children with pinworms have no symptoms. Some children get very itchy around the anus and vagina, especially at night. If the infection is bad, your child can lose sleep and become cranky.
What can parents do?
If you think your child has pinworms, contact your doctor. A simple test will check for pinworms. They can be treated with an oral medication that can take up to 2 weeks to work. Itching can continue for at least a week after taking the medication. Your doctor may give your child a second dose after 2 weeks.
Try to keep your child from scratching. Bathing your child in the morning will help get rid of many of the eggs. 
How can I prevent pinworms from spreading?
Pinworms can come back if your child comes into contact with pinworm eggs again. They can stay alive in your home for up to 2 to 3 weeks. 
Make sure everyone in your family washes their hands carefully after going to the toilet, changing diapers, and before preparing or eating food.
Wash your bed linens and clothes. Don’t shake them because this can scatter the eggs.
Keep everyone’s fingernails short and avoid nail-biting.
The eggs are sensitive to sunlight. Open blinds or curtains in bedrooms during the day when your child isn’t sleeping.

RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus),"RSV (Respiratory syncytial virus)
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common virus that can infect the lungs and breathing tubes. RSV infection is most serious in young babies. Almost all children get the virus at least once before they are 2 years old. Older children and adults also get RSV at least every few years but do not usually get very sick from it. 
How is it spread?
RSV is very contagious. The virus is most common between late fall and early spring. RSV spreads the same way as a common cold:
By touching droplets containing the virus after someone coughs or sneezes.
By being close (less than 2 meters apart) to someone with the infection who is coughing or sneezing. Droplets from the infected person can reach another person’s nose or mouth.
By touching something that has been touched by an infected person, such as toys, door handles, furniture or countertops.
What are the symptoms of RSV?
Children with RSV have the same symptoms as a common cold, which may include:
coughing,
a runny nose,
fever,
a decrease in appetite and energy,
irritability.
Some children (most often very young babies) have bronchiolitis - an infection of the tiny airways that lead to the lungs that causes wheezing and difficulty breathing.
How is RSV treated?
RSV is usually mild and doesn’t need any treatment. Most children get better within a week or two. Sometimes children need to be hospitalized so that they can be watched closely and given fluids or oxygen if needed.
Because RSV is a virus, antibiotics will not help a child get better faster. Antibiotics kill bacteria, not viruses.
How can I protect my children from RSV?
Keep babies under 6 months old away from people with colds, if possible.
Wash your hands and your children’s hands often to reduce the spread of germs.
Breastfeed your baby. Breast milk contains antibodies and other immune factors that help prevent and fight off illness.
Don’t smoke. Make sure that your children are not around cigarette smoke, especially in the car or in your home.
Make sure your child receives all recommended immunizations. Vaccines won’t prevent your child from getting RSV or other viruses that cause colds, but they will protect your child from some of the complications a cold can cause.
There is a special injection to prevent RSV infection called palivizumab, but it is only given to children at risk of severe RSV (mainly babies with heart or lung disease or those who were born very early). It has to be given monthly during RSV season.
What can I do if my child is sick?
Keep your child as comfortable as possible and offer plenty of fluids.
Give acetaminophen or ibuprofen for fever. Ibuprofen should only be given if your child is drinking reasonably well. Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months old without first talking to your doctor.
If your baby is having trouble drinking, try to clear nasal congestion gently with a bulb syringe or with saline (salt water) nose drops.
Do not give over-the-counter cough and cold medicines to a child younger than 6 years old. Although these drugs do not need a doctor’s prescription, they are not safe in young children. 
If you are using cough and cold medicines for children older than 6 years, read instructions carefully and give only the recommended dose.
When should I call a doctor?
Take your baby to an emergency department if your child:
has trouble breathing or has lips that look blue,
is younger than 3 months old and has a fever, or
is no longer able to suck or drink.
See a doctor if your child:
has had a fever for more than 72 hours,
is not eating or is vomiting,
is not having wet diapers, or
is coughing so bad that they are choking or vomiting.

Ringworm,"Ringworm
What is ringworm?
Ringworm is the name for a group of skin infections caused fungus that live on the dead tissues of the skin, hair, and nails. The term “ringworm” doesn’t mean the infection is caused by worms.
What are the symptoms?
The infection causes a rash that may have a ring shape with a raised edge.
It can have scaly patches that are quite itchy and flaky. They can happen on the scalp, body, groin or feet.
When the scalp is infected, there is often an area of baldness.
Fungal infections on the feet are also known as “athlete’s foot”. They are usually very itchy and cause skin cracking between the toes.
How is it spread?
The fungus sticks to the fingers or gets under fingernails when someone with ringworm touches or scratches the rash. Fungi grow in moist, warm areas, such as locker rooms and swimming pools, then spreads when a person touches someone else or through contact with infected items like combs, unwashed clothing or shower and pool surfaces.
It’s also possible to become infected from contact with animals, like cats and dogs.
How can I protect my child or teen?
Teach your child not to share their comb, hairbrush, face cloths or towels.
Make sure your child or teen wears flip-flops on their feet in the locker room shower or at the pool.
Wash sports clothing regularly. Because the fungi are on your skin, it’s important to shower after contact sports.
Wash your hands often, especially after touching pets. It’s also a good idea to avoid touching pets with bald spots.
How is it treated?
Usually the skin can be treated with an antifungal ointment or cream that is applied to the infected area for at least 2-3 weeks. For more severe infections and scalp infections, prescription medication may need to be taken orally (by mouth).
When should I call the doctor?
If you think your child has ringworm, see your doctor.
If your child has ringworm, they should not return to child care or to school until after treatment has started.

Roseola,"Roseola
What is roseola?
Roseola is a viral illness. It’s most common in children between 6 months and 2 years of age.
How does it spread?
Direct contact: When someone comes into contact with an infected person’s saliva (spit) on their hands and then rubs their eyes or nose.
Indirect contact: When germs in the nose and throat of an infected person spread through the air—as droplets from a cough or sneeze.
How can I prevent roseola from spreading?
Hand washing is the best way to reduce the spread of viral infections.
What are the symptoms of roseola?
Roseola usually starts with a high fever (often over 39.5°C or 103° F) that lasts for 3-5 days.
Most children are not very sick during the fever stage. But for some children the fever can be associated with febrile seizures (or convulsions).
Your child may be cranky and irritable.
When the fever ends, a rash of small pinkish- red spots develops on your child’s face and body. The spots will turn white when you touch them and they might have a lighter ring around them. The rash usually spreads to the neck, face, arms, and legs. It can last from a couple of hours to up to 2 days. It is usually not itchy.
What can parents do?
Despite the fever and rash, most children with roseola do not get very sick and the condition gets better without treatment.
Antibiotics cannot be used to treat roseola because it is caused by a virus, not a bacteria.
Keep your child comfortable and offer your child plenty of fluids until he starts to feel well again.
Children do not need to be treated for fever unless they are uncomfortable.
Children can continue to attend daycare or school if they feel well enough.
When should I call the doctor?
Call the doctor if your child:
has a fever for more than 72 hours.
is under 6 months old and has a fever.
has a seizure.
is lethargic or dehydrated.

Everyone who lives in the home will need to be treated for scabies at the same time because a family member can have scabies but not show symptoms yet.
Scabies is a common skin condition caused by tiny insects called mites. Scabies can be unpleasant but they do not directly cause disease. If the skin gets infected, it can lead to complications
Having scabies doesn’t mean you are not clean.
What are the symptoms?
The mites that cause scabies dig deep into the skin and lay eggs. This leads to a rash that has small, red, raised spots. Itchiness is usually worse at night.
The rash typically appears between the fingers, in the groin area, between toes or around the wrists or elbows, but can be found anywhere on the body.
In babies and young children, the rash can appear on the head, face, neck, chest, abdomen, and back. It looks like white, curvy, thread-like lines, tiny red bumps or scratch marks.
How does it spread?
Scabies spreads by close contact with someone’s skin, such as when people share a bed. It often spreads within a household. Short contact, like shaking hands or a hug, usually will not spread scabies. It is occasionally spread from someone’s clothes or personal items like bedding or clothing.
The mites that cause scabies can live off skin for up to 3 days.
Animals do not spread human scabies.
How is it treated?
Scabies is treated with a cream or lotion that a health care provider prescribes. It is usually kept on the skin for several hours. You may need to do 2 treatments, 1 week apart.
Your child may still be itchy for a few weeks, even if the mites have all died.
Everyone who lives in the home will need to be treated at the same time because a family member can have scabies without yet showing symptoms.
What can parents do?
Call your health care provider if you think your child has scabies.
If your child has scabies, wash all bed linen (sheets, pillowcases and blankets), towels and clothes in hot water and dry in a dryer at the hottest setting. This will kill the mites.
Store things that can’t be washed in an airtight plastic bag for 1 week to kill the mites.
Your child can return to child care or school once you have applied the first treatment.

Strep throat,"Strep throat
What is strep throat?
Strep throat is an infection caused by a bacteria (germ) called Group A Streptococcus. It is more common in children than adults.
What are the symptoms?
Not all sore throats are strep throat. Children with strep throat usually have:
a very sore throat,
trouble swallowing,
swollen and tender neck nodes, and
fever.
 Your child may also complain of headache, nausea or a sore stomach.
Children with strep throat do not usually have cold symptoms (cough and runny nose).
How do children get strep throat?
Direct contact: When someone comes into contact with an infected person’s saliva (spit), nose or sore on the skin.
Indirect contact: When germs in the nose and throat of an infected person spread through the air—as droplets from a cough or sneeze.
How is it diagnosed?
Your doctor cannot diagnose strep throat just by looking at your child’s throat. He will have to take a throat swab. That means collecting a bit of fluid from the back and sides of your child’s throat, using a long cotton swab. The fluid is then tested for the strep bacteria.
How is it treated?
Although strep throat usually gets better without treatment, some children can get complications if they are not treated. Children get better faster when treated with an antibiotic. Your doctor will decide if an antibiotic is needed.
What can parents do?
If you think your child might have strep throat, see your doctor.
If your child has strep throat:
Washing your hands and your child’s hands is the best thing that you can do to stop the spread of germs.
Teach your child to cover their mouth with a tissue or with their sleeve or elbow when coughing or sneezing.
If your child has fever, give acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
Ibuprofen should only be given if your child is drinking reasonably well.
Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months without first talking to your doctor.
Do not alternate between using acetaminophen and ibuprofen as this can lead to dosing errors.
A child or teenager with a fever should not be given aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)]. 
Make sure your child gets plenty of rest and fluids.
Gargling with warm salt water can help soothe a sore throat.
Keep your child home from child care or school until they have taken the antibiotic for at least one full day.
Your child should take all the medication prescribed by the doctor, even if the signs of illness have gone away.

Thrush,"Thrush
What is thrush?
Thrush is a common mouth infection in infants. It is caused by yeast called Candida albicans.
Candida is often found in babies’ mouths without causing any problems. But because their immune systems are still developing, sometimes the amount of yeast can overgrow and lead to an infection. 
Thrush is more common after a child has taken antibiotics for some other infection.
What are the symptoms of thrush?
Thrush looks like whitish-grey patches on the inside of the cheek, the roof of the mouth or on the tongue. Although the patches look like milk, they cannot be rubbed off. Thrush is not usually painful.
Some babies with thrush also develop a yeast diaper infection which looks like red, shiny skin in the folds of leg and buttock skin. There may be tiny red spots scattered over the diaper area, lower stomach and upper thighs. It usually spreads to the entire diaper area.
Breastfed babies and their mothers can have a yeast infection at the same time and pass it to each other. The infection can be in the baby's mouth and on the breast or in the mother’s milk ducts in her breast. Women whose breasts are infected with Candida can experience:
red, pink and sensitive nipples,
shiny or flaky skin on the areola,
unusual pain during nursing or painful nipples between feedings, and/or
stabbing pains deep within the breast.
How is thrush treated?
Mild thrush usually clears up on its own and without treatment.
If the thrush doesn’t clear up after a few days, see your doctor. They may prescribe an anti-fungal liquid medication.
The medication is usually taken 4 times a day and continued until 2 days after the infection has cleared up. The medication must touch the areas of thrush to be effective. Proper treatment will help prevent the infection from coming back.
Always remember to clean bottle nipples and pacifiers carefully in hot water after each use.
Use breast pads without a plastic barrier. The plastic can encourage the growth of Candida.
Call your doctor if:
You are breastfeeding. You may need treatment to prevent the infection from passing back and forth between you and your baby.
Your baby develops painful white lesions inside the mouth.
Your baby has a yeast diaper rash. Your doctor can prescribe an anti-fungal medication to use in the diaper area.
Your child is older than 9 months and is getting thrush often.

Urinary tract infections,"Urinary tract infections
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are very common in children. The urinary tract is made up of the kidneys, ureters (tubes that move urine from kidney to the bladder), bladder, and urethra (a tube connects the bladder to the genitals). An infection can happen anywhere along this tract, but they are most common in the kidneys and bladder. An infection of the bladder is called cystitis, while an infection involving the kidney is called pyelonephritis, or “pyelo”.
Most UTIs are caused by a bacteria called Escherichia coli (E. coli), but there are also other bacteria that can sometimes cause a UTI.
Are some children at higher risk for urinary tract infections?
UTIs are more common in girls than in boys. A girl’s urethra is short so bacteria can easily get into the bladder. Children with a urinary system that is abnormal are also more at risk for a UTI.  
How do I know if my child has a urinary tract infection?
Young infants and children who have a UTI may be irritable or have a fever for no apparent reason.
Older children might also:
feel pain or a burning sensation when peeing,
feel a strong urge to pee or need to pee more often than usual, or start having small accidents well after toilet learning is complete,
have a fever,
feel pain in the lower back or pain in the belly just below the navel,
have foul-smelling urine that can look cloudy or have a little blood.
How will my doctor test for a urinary tract infection?
To diagnose a UTI, your doctor will need one or two urine samples to see if there is inflammation or bacteria. Urine collected for bacteria needs to be free of skin or stool contamination. How you provide the sample may depend on your child’s age:
If you have an infant, a doctor or nurse may use a catheter (small tube inserted into the urethra) so urine can be collected in a sterile bag for testing. This is the best way to test for a UTI.   
If your child is toilet-trained, they will need to provide a mid-stream urine sample in a sterile cup or jar. “Mid-stream” means that the child pees a little bit and then you collect the urine.
How is a urinary tract infection treated?
UTIs are treated with antibiotics. If your child is younger than 2 years old and has a UTI, your doctor may do additional tests to be sure your child’s urinary tract is working properly.
When should I call the doctor?
Call your doctor if your child:
is under 6 months old and has a fever,
is older than 6 months and has had a fever for more than 48 hours,
is in pain when urinating, or has foul-smelling urine,
has suddenly started having accidents during the day or at night time after many months of being dry, 
has blood in the urine, and/or
has severe stomach or back pain.
How can I prevent my child from getting a urinary tract infection?
Teach your child to use the toilet when they feels the urge and not to hold it. Urine that is held in the bladder can help bacteria grow. This is also important for bowel movements.
Children with constipation are more prone to UTIs. If your child has hard stools or painful bowel movements, try to increase the fibre in their diet. If this does not work, speak to your doctor.
Avoid bubble baths and washing with strong soaps that can cause irritation.

West Nile virus,"West Nile virus
West Nile virus is spread by mosquitoes that have fed on the blood of infected birds. Infected mosquitoes pass the virus to people through bites.
Do mosquitoes everywhere carry the virus?
Not every mosquito carries West Nile virus and not every person bitten by a mosquito will get West Nile virus.
In Canada, the virus can be found in mosquitoes in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta. Cases have been reported in Atlantic Canada and British Columbia, but to date, these have been travel-related.
If you live in an area where the virus is active, you should protect yourself and your family.
In Canada, infection with West Nile virus almost always happens in August and September unless a person has recently travelled outside of Canada.
The Public Health Agency of Canada keeps track of where the virus is active.
What are the symptoms of infection with West Nile virus?
Usually, people with the virus will have no symptoms. If symptoms do happen, it’s usually between 3 and 14 days after you were bitten by an infected mosquito.
Symptoms are often flu-like and can include fever, aches and fatigue. In very few cases, the virus can cause a serious illness like encephalitis (swelling of the brain), meningitis (brain infection) or paralysis.
Is West Nile virus dangerous to children?
Serious illness from West Nile virus is much more common in adults than children. Most children who get the virus have either no symptoms or only a mild illness. Still, it’s possible for children to get very sick. But this is very rare.
Children with a weak immune system or who already have a serious illness are most at risk of becoming very sick.
What can I do to protect my family?
The best protection against West Nile virus is to avoid mosquito bites. There is no treatment or vaccine to prevent the disease.
If you live in an area where the virus is active, protect your children whenever they are outside.

Mosquitoes breed in standing water (water that isn’t moving), even very small amounts. To reduce the number of breeding spots around your home:
Drain standing water from items like toys, flower pots, cans, buckets, barrels and pool covers often.
Remove things where water can collect, like old tires.
Clean or change the water in swimming pools, decorative pools, children’s wading pools and bird baths often.
Clean out clogged gutters.
Cover rain barrels with screens.
Reduce the chance of being bitten
Mosquitoes are most active at dawn and dusk. Wear protective clothing or using insect repellant if you go outside at these times.
Windows and doors should have a screen that fits tightly and has no holes.
Use mosquito nets or screens for baby strollers.
Wear protective clothing when possible: light-coloured clothing with long sleeves and cuffs, long pants tucked into socks or shoes, and hats are recommended.
Use insect repellents
Insect repellents don’t kill mosquitoes, but they help keep mosquitoes away. Read Caring for Kids information on using insect repellents in children.

5-in-1 or 6-in-1 vaccine,"5-in-1 or 6-in-1 vaccine
You can protect your children from 5 diseases by giving them 1 easy vaccine. The 5-in-1 vaccine protects against:
Diphtheria
Tetanus
Pertussis (whooping cough)
Polio
Hib disease
In some provinces, hepatitis B vaccine is also included, making it a 6-in-1 vaccine.
In Canada, most children get the 5-in-1 vaccine when they are 2, 4, 6, and 18 months old. The 6-in-1 vaccine may replace 5-in-1 at 2, 4 and 6 or at 2, 4 and 18 months. Only three doses of hepatitis B vaccine are needed.
Your child will get a booster of the 4-in-1 vaccine at 4 to 6 years of age. The 4-in-1 shot vaccine protects against:
Diphtheria
Tetanus
Pertussis
Polio
A booster of Hib vaccine is not needed if your child already received all 4 doses of the 5-in-1 vaccine.
For complete protection, your child needs to receive all vaccines at the right time. Ask your doctor or nurse for a record book to help you keep track of your child’s immunizations.
What is diphtheria?
Diphtheria is an illness caused by bacteria (germs). It produces a poison (toxin) that kills cells in the lining of the throat and causes serious breathing problems. It can also attack the heart, nerves and kidneys.
About 1 person in 10 with diphtheria will die from the illness. Babies who get it are even more likely to die.
Diphtheria must be treated with an anti-toxin (a serum that fights the poison). Antibiotics have no effect on the disease but are used to prevent the spread of the bacteria to others.
People who get diphtheria do not always become immune. Everyone needs to be vaccinated.
What is tetanus?
Also called lockjaw, tetanus is caused by germs (bacteria) that are found in dirt and dust as spores (seed-like cells). These bacteria live in the intestines (bowels) of people and animals and can be found in the stools.
Tetanus is not contagious: it does not spread from person to person.
If the tetanus germ gets into an open cut, like a puncture, bite or serious burn, poison (toxin) from the germ can spread to your nerves and then to your muscles. Muscles may lock in one place or go into spasm (get very tight). This is very painful.
Jaw muscles are often the first affected. You may not be able to swallow or open your mouth. If the poison gets to the muscles that help you breathe, you can die quickly.
The main treatment for tetanus is anti-toxin (a serum that fights the poison).
Antibiotics are also given to kill the germs. Other drugs are used to control the muscle spasms. A machine may be needed to help breathing.
Between 1 and 8 people in 10 with tetanus will die.
People who survive tetanus may have long-lasting problems with speech, memory and thinking.
People who survive can get tetanus again. Infection does not give immunity. Everyone needs the vaccine. 
What is pertussis?
Also called whooping cough, pertussis is caused by germs that get into the throat and lungs and makes it difficult to clear mucous from the airways.
Children may cough so long and so hard that they can’t breathe. Young infants may not be able to cough forcefully and may stop breathing.
Babies with whooping cough may have fits (seizures) and in serious cases, go into a coma.
About 1 in 400 infants with pertussis dies because of pneumonia or brain damage.
Older children, adolescents and adults who get whooping cough will cough for more than 3 weeks, and cough may last up to 12 weeks.
Coughing disturbs sleep and may be severe enough to cause a rib fracture or a hernia or loss of control of urine.
What is polio?
Polio is an infection caused by a virus called poliovirus.
Some people with polio don’t feel sick at all.
Symptoms can include fever, sore throat, headache, muscle aches and pains, drowsiness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and constipation. It can also cause meningitis (headache and stiffness in the neck and back).
About 1 in every 100 people who get the virus will get a severe form of the disease, which causes paralysis (not able to move arms or legs). If the chest muscles are paralyzed, the person cannot breathe and will need a machine to breathe for them.
Some people die from polio. Most of those who survive are paralyzed for the rest of their lives.
What is Hib disease?
Hib stands for Haemophilus Influenzae type b. Despite its name, it has nothing to do with the flu.
Hib is a bacteria (germ) that starts in the nose or throat and can infect almost any other part of the body, such as the brain, lungs, heart, joints, bones and skin.
It can cause a very serious disease called meningitis when it infects the fluid and covering of the brain and spinal cord.
Without treatment, all children with Hib meningitis die. Even with treatment, about 1 in 20 children with Hib meningitis will die.
About 1 in 3 children who live will have permanent brain damage.
What is hepatitis B infection?
Hepatitis B is a disease caused by a virus that infects the liver. For more information, please visit the hepatitis B page.
How safe are the 5-in-1 and 6-in-1 shots?
They are very safe.
Children who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine (swelling of the face or lips, difficulty breathing or if your blood pressure drops) should not get it again unless seen by a specialist and vaccinated in a special clinic that can control severe reactions.  
Are there any side effects to the vaccine?
With any vaccine, there may be some redness, swelling, tenderness or pain where the needle went into the arm or leg. 
Fever is common.
How can I minimize the pain?
Needles can hurt. To lessen the pain you can:
Apply a topical anesthetic (a cream that causes temporary numbness) an hour before getting the needle. You may have to ask your doctor or nurse where the shot will be given (for example, in the arm or leg). Your pharmacist can help you find the cream.
Nurse your baby while he gets the needle, or give your baby sugar water (with a teaspoon or pacifier) just before the shot.
For older children, use distractions (blow bubbles, read a book), suggest deep breathing, remain calm and physically comfort your child (cuddle, hold hands) during the needle.
Do not give your child ibuprofen or acetaminophen before or around the time of vaccination as it does not prevent the pain of injection and it could have an impact on how well the vaccine works. These medications can be used to treat fever, pain, or other bothersome side effects if they develop after vaccination.

Chickenpox,"Chickenpox
Chickenpox (varicella) is a common, preventable childhood infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It’s most common in young children and is usually mild, but can be very uncomfortable for your child. When adolescents and adults get it, they can be very sick.
Chickenpox is very dangerous for people with immune system problems like leukemia, or for people taking medications that weaken the immune system.
What are the symptoms?
Chickenpox begins with a fever, aches and pains.
Within 1 or 2 days your child will get a rash. The rash is usually itchy and can make your child uncomfortable. It appears on the scalp and face, spreading quickly down the body and onto the arms and legs. The spots start as flat pink spots that turn into small water blisters. New spots will form even after others turn into blisters. Some children only get a few blisters, but others can have as many as 500. Blisters open, dry up and form scabs in 4 or 5 days.
Most children lose their appetite and have a headache during the first few days.
How is it spread?
Chickenpox spreads to others very easily. Because it can spread from 2 days before the rash appears, it often spreads without anyone knowing. It can continue to spread until all of the blisters have scabbed. 
The virus enters the body by the nose or mouth. It usually develops 2 to 3 weeks after contact with an infected person.
It is mainly spread through the air. The virus can survive in the air for several hours. It can be caught by being in a room with an infected person or in a room where someone with chickenpox has been recently.
It also spreads from person to person through direct contact with the virus. You can get chickenpox if you touch a blister, or the liquid or wet crust from a blister.
A pregnant woman with chickenpox can pass it on to her baby before birth.
Mothers with chickenpox can also give it to their newborn babies after birth.
If one of your children has chickenpox, it will probably spread to other members of the household who have not already had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine.
Chickenpox cannot live on objects like sheets, counters or toys. 
Can chickenpox cause bigger problems?
Babies who get chickenpox from their mothers before birth could be born with birth defects like skin scars, eye problems, brain damage or arms and legs that are not fully formed.
Chickenpox can be very severe or even life-threatening to babies in the first month of life, to adolescents and adults, and to anyone who has a weak immune system.
Children with chickenpox can get pneumonia (infection of the lungs) or get inflammation of the brain.
The blisters can get infected with bacteria and this can lead to lifelong scars. Though most of these infections are minor and clear up on their own, some can lead to a serious illness called necrotizing fasciitis (or “flesh-eating disease”).
Can you have chickenpox twice?
In most cases, you can only get chickenpox once. This is called life-long immunity. But in rare cases, a person might get it again, especially if they were very young when they had it the first time.
What is shingles?
Shingles looks like chickenpox and is caused by the same virus. But it usually appears on only one part of the body, where it causes pain. Shingles can happen in people who have already had chickenpox but usually many years later since after we have chickenpox, the virus stays with us in an inactive form. Shingles is contagious, but only to those who have never had chickenpox.
How can I treat chickenpox?
If your child gets chickenpox, do not give aspirin [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)] or any products that contain aspirin. Taking aspirin increases the risk of getting Reye’s syndrome. This severe illness can damage the liver and brain. If you want to control your child’s fever, use acetaminophen (Tylenol, Tempra, Panadol and others).
Encourage your child not to scratch. Scratching can cause infection from bacteria that get into the skin. Adding baking soda to bathwater can be soothing. Your doctor may recommend a cream to help reduce the itch.
Infants with chickenpox, and older children or adults with a severe disease may be treated with antiviral drugs.
When should I call the doctor?
A new fever develops after the first couple of days. That is, the fever goes away for a day or so and returns.
Your child looks ill (not wanting to play, eat or drink), especially if they also have a high fever or have many spots inside the mouth.
A chickenpox spot becomes enlarged, red or very sore. Your doctor will decide if your child has developed a bacterial infection that needs antibiotics.
Can my child with chickenpox go to child care or school?
Many schools and daycare centres have policies that require children with chickenpox to stay home for 5 days after the rash appears. The goal is to protect other children from the disease. Unfortunately, this does not stop chickenpox from spreading.
Chickenpox is contagious from 1 to 2 days before the rash appears, and most infectious from 12 to 24 hours before the rash appears. It spreads through the air, not just by direct contact with the rash. Policies that require that your child stay home for a period of time don’t work because by the time it’s known that a child has chickenpox, it has already been passed on to other children.
If your child is too sick to take part in regular activities or if they have a fever, they should stay home. For mild cases (low fever for a short period of time and only a little rash, less than 30 spots), children can go to school or child care if they feel well enough to take part in regular activities, and if the facility permits.
What if I’m pregnant?
Pregnant women can develop severe chickenpox. Most adult women are already protected against chickenpox by antibodies in their blood. If you are thinking of getting pregnant and have not had chickenpox, you should be vaccinated. If you are pregnant and have not had chickenpox, call your doctor right away if you are exposed to chickenpox. Your doctor may want to give you a special type of immune globulin (VariZIG) that has antibodies to chickenpox to help prevent you from getting a severe infection. 
If you catch chickenpox early in your pregnancy, there is a 2% chance of it harming your unborn baby. 
How can I protect my child?
The best way to protect your child from chickenpox is vaccination. If your child is not yet vaccinated and comes in contact with another child or family member who has chickenpox, they may still be protected if they are vaccinated right away.
If your child has an immune system disorder and comes in contact with chickenpox, call your doctor right away. The doctor can give a special type of immune globulin (VariZIG) with a large concentration of antibodies to chickenpox to help prevent infection, or early treatment with an antiviral drug.

Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (dTap) vaccine,"Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (dTap) vaccine
If you are a teenager, you need a booster shot for 3 serious diseases: diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (whooping cough).
You were probably vaccinated against these diseases when you were much younger. Now, it’s time to protect yourself again.
Why do teenagers need this vaccine?
Babies get a 5-in-1 shot that includes diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccines. 
When they are between 4 and 6 years old, preschool children get a 4-in-1 shot, which protects against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and polio.
The vaccines against diphtheria and tetanus protect you for about 10 years. Recently, many teenagers have been getting whooping cough because the protection from their earlier shots has worn off. 
The sixth dose of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine will help prevent teenagers from getting these diseases.  
On the other hand, boosters for Hib and polio are not needed. Hib does not cause serious disease in healthy older children, adolescents and adults; and immunity after polio vaccine lasts for many, many years.   
What is tetanus?
Also called lockjaw, tetanus is caused by germs (bacteria) that are found in dirt and dust as spores (seed-like cells). These bacteria live in the intestines (bowels) of people and animals and can be found in the stools.
Tetanus is not contagious. It does not spread from person to person.
If the tetanus germ gets into an open cut, like a puncture,  bite or serious burn, poison (toxin) from the germ can spread to your nerves and then to your muscles. Muscles may lock in one place or go into spasm (get very tight). This is very painful.
Jaw muscles are often the first affected. You may not be able to swallow or open your mouth. If the poison gets to the muscles that help you breathe, you can die quickly.
The main treatment for tetanus is anti-toxin (a serum that fights the poison).
Antibiotics are also given to kill the germs. Other drugs are used to control the muscle spasms. A machine may be needed to help breathing.
Between 1 and 8 people in 10 with tetanus will die.
People who survive tetanus may have long-lasting problems with speech, memory and thinking.
People who survive can get tetanus again. Infection does not give immunity. Everyone needs the vaccine. 
What is diphtheria?
Diphtheria is an illness caused by bacteria (germs). It produces a poison (toxin) that kills cells in the lining of the throat and causes serious breathing problems. It can also attack the heart, nerves and kidneys.
About 1 person in 10 with diphtheria will die from the illness. Babies who get it are even more likely to die.
Diphtheria must be treated with an anti-toxin (a serum that fights the poison). Antibiotics have no effect on the disease but are used to prevent the spread of the bacteria to others.

Also called whooping cough, pertussis is caused by germs that get into the throat and lungs and makes it difficult to clear mucous from the airways.
Children may cough so long and so hard that they can’t breathe. Young infants may not be able to cough forcefully and may stop breathing.
Babies with whooping cough may have fits (seizures) and in serious cases, go into a coma.
About 1 in 400 infants with pertussis dies because of pneumonia or brain damage.
Older children, adolescents and adults who get whooping cough will cough for more than 3 weeks, and cough may last up to 12 weeks.
Coughing disturbs sleep, and in adolescence or adults may be severe enough to cause a rib fracture or a hernia or loss of control of urine.
How safe is the dTap vaccine?
The combined diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine is very safe.
Teenagers who have had a serious allergic reaction to a dose of the 5-in-1 or 4-in-1 vaccine (swelling of the face or lips, difficulty breathing or a drop in blood pressure) should not get this vaccine unless seen by a specialist and vaccinated in a special clinic that can control severe reaction.  
Are there any side effects to the vaccine?
With any vaccine, there may be some redness, swelling, pain or tenderness where the needle went into the arm or leg.
Some teenagers will have a fever after they get the shot. Ask your doctor what you can do to control the fever or pain.
Where can I get the vaccine?
This vaccine is given by your doctor or in school-based programs. If you missed the school-based program, talk to your paediatrician or family doctor.

HPV: What teens need to know,"HPV: What teens need to know
Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) in Canada. That means it passes from person to person through sexual contact. 
There are over 100 types of HPV but only a few of them cause serious diseases. Some types can infect the genital and oral areas of men and women. 
How is it spread?
HPV infection can be passed through any type of sexual activity (vaginal, oral, anal or petting), not just intercourse. Some types of HPV are spread by skin-to-skin contact.
HPV is very common and very contagious. Teens have high rates of infection. People usually get it after they start any type of sexual activity.
As many as 3 in 4 Canadians get HPV sometime during their life. 
Does HPV make people sick?
Most people don’t know they have HPV, because usually there are no symptoms.
Some people with HPV will have genital warts (flat, flesh-colored bumps or cauliflower-like bumps that vary in size). In women, genital warts can grow on the vulva, the area between vagina and anus, in the vagina and on the cervix. In men, genital warts can grow on the penis, near the anus, on the scrotum, or between the penis and the scrotum. 
HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer (cancer of the cervix) in women. 
HPV can also cause cancer of the vulva in women, and penile (penis) cancer in men. Men and women can also get oral and anal cancers.
Most people who are infected with HPV do not develop cancer. If it happens, the cancer develops slowly, after the virus has been in the body for many years.
Is there an HPV vaccine?
There is a safe and effective vaccine that can help protect girls and women, boys and men from the kinds of HPV that most often cause cancer and warts. 
Children 9 years of age and older, as well as adults, should get this vaccine. For best results, all children should be vaccinated at 9 to 13 years old, before they engage in sexual contact.
To be protected you will need 2 or 3 doses of vaccine, depending on your age and which vaccine is used. If 3 doses, the second dose is given 2 months after the first, and the third dose at least 6 months after the first. If 2 doses, the second dose is given 6 to 12 months after the first. 
Do I need it if I am not having sex yet?
The best way to protect yourself from any STI is to not have sex. However, even if you are not having sex (intercourse) you can still become infected with HPV through sexual touching or oral sex. 
For the vaccine to work the best, you need to get it before you start any sexual activity. Remember that it may take up to a month after the last dose before you are protected. 
Does the HPV vaccine protect against all sexually transmitted infections?
No. The HPV vaccine does not protect against other STIs. It also does not protect against all types of HPV. 
The vaccine does not work as well if you have already been infected with the kinds of HPV that are in the vaccine. 
If you are sexually active, safe sex practices—including using a condom—can help reduce the risk of other infections. 
If you are a sexually active female, even if you have received the HPV vaccine, you should have regular Pap tests. A Pap test looks for very early signs of cervical cancer. 
How safe is the HPV vaccine?
It is very safe. The vaccine has already been given safely to millions of girls, boys and young adults. You cannot get HPV from the vaccine. 
With any vaccine, there may be some redness, swelling or pain where the needle went into the arm or leg.  
Is there any reason to NOT get the vaccine?
If you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant, you should not get vaccinated because the vaccine has not yet been tested in pregnancy. However, in cases where the vaccine has been given to women who did not yet know they were pregnant, there were no bad effects on the mother or the baby.
People who have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the vaccine (swelling of the face or lips, difficulty breathing or if your blood pressure drops) should not get it again unless seen by a specialist and vaccinated in a special clinic that can control severe reactions. 
You do not need to delay getting the vaccine if you are sick with a minor cold or have a minor fever. 
Where can I get the vaccine?
In most provinces, boys and girls can get the vaccine as part of a program at school. If it is not given at school, talk to your doctor about the vaccine.

Hepatitis A,"Hepatitis A
What is hepatitis A?
Hepatitis A is an infection of the liver caused by a virus (a germ that can make people sick). The disease is usually mild in children, but can be more serious in adults.
How is hepatitis A spread?
Hepatitis A virus is found in the stool of infected people. It can spread directly from person to person or in food or water that has been contaminated with stool that has the virus. To prevent this, be sure that everyone in your house always washes their hands with soap and water after every diaper change or after using the toilet, and before preparing or eating food.
What are the symptoms?
Most infants and young children infected with hepatitis A have no symptoms or mild symptoms. Most of the time, no one knows that they even had hepatitis A. Older children, teens and adults are much more likely to become sick when infected with hepatitis A. 
Symptoms can include:
fever,
fatigue,
loss of appetite,
nausea,
vomiting,
abdominal pain,
yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice).
Rarely, hepatitis A infection causes such severe disease that the liver stops working and the person can die. In other cases, a liver transplant may be needed.
How is it diagnosed?
Hepatitis A is diagnosed with a blood test.
How can it be treated?
There are no drugs to treat hepatitis A. It is a short-term infection that will go away on its own. Unlike hepatitis B, people with hepatitis A do not become carriers (infected for life). 
Is there a vaccine?
In Canada, there are several hepatitis A vaccines available for children 1 year of age or older and adults who are at risk of getting hepatitis A or to prevent infection after being exposed. Speak to your doctor about the vaccine that is best for you. If necessary, hepatitis A vaccine may be given to babies as young as 6 months. 
How can I prevent the spread of Hepatitis A?
Hepatitis A can be prevented in people who are known to have been in recent close contact with an infected person. They need to get hepatitis A vaccine. Some people (young babies and people who have a weak immune system) may also be given immunoglobulin (IG – a product made from blood that has protective antibodies). The vaccine or IG must be given as soon as possible after they have been exposed. 
What can parents do?
Make sure everyone in the house washes their hands after going to the toilet or changing a diaper, and before preparing or eating food.
If you know your child has hepatitis A, they should not return to a child care facility or school until 1 week after the illness started.
If you or your child is travelling to a country where the disease is common, you should get the vaccine before leaving Canada.
For more information about where hepatitis A is common, visit the Public Health Agency of Canada’s website.

Hepatitis B,"Hepatitis B
Hepatitis B is a disease caused by a virus that infects the liver. Half of all people with hepatitis B don’t know they have it because they don’t feel sick. But they can still pass the disease to others. Some will become carriers and have the virus in their blood and other body fluids for the rest of their lives.
In other cases, hepatitis B makes people very sick with fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, and yellow skin and eyes (jaundice). They can be sick for weeks or months. Many people will get better and become immune (protected from the illness) for life. Some will recover but remain infected and become carriers. Those who become infected at a younger age are more likely to become carriers. Most infants infected before 1 year of age will be infected for life.
Carriers are also at high risk for getting liver disease, liver failure, and cancer of the liver. There is no cure for hepatitis B, but treatment can sometimes decrease the amount of virus in the blood and body secretions. It can also prevent some of the other problems caused by the disease.
How common is hepatitis B?
In Canada, there are now less than 200 new infections per year, but many more people are living with the infection as carriers. Most new cases now come from sharing needles or having sex with a carrier. Many babies used to get hepatitis B at birth, but this doesn’t happen very often anymore since pregnant people are tested for the disease. Babies whose mothers have the disease get a vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin (a shot with a large amount of antibodies) soon after they are born.
In other parts of the world, hepatitis B is more common and still infects many babies. If you travel to China, Southeast Asia or some parts of Africa, you may be at higher risk, especially if you have sex with local people, use drugs with a needle, or need a blood transfusion.
How can you tell if you have hepatitis B?
Your doctor will have to do a blood test. Talk to your doctor if you are concerned that you may already be infected, even if you feel well. 
How does hepatitis B spread?
It spreads from person to person through body fluids, such as blood, saliva, semen, and vaginal fluids.
It can spread:
through contact with blood or body fluids if these get into a cut or break in the skin or into the eyes or mouth.
during sex.
from sharing needles during drug use.
from infected and non-sterilized needles in a tattoo or piercing shop.
from sharing toothbrushes or razors (these may have tiny amounts of blood on them).
from a mother to her baby when she is pregnant or giving birth.
What can you do to stop the spread of hepatitis B?
Get the hepatitis B vaccine.
If you are pregnant, have a blood test to see if you have hepatitis B.
If someone in your house has hepatitis B, everyone else should get the vaccine against it.
If someone is bleeding, avoid touching the blood or any blood-tinged fluids with your bare hands.
Wear gloves to clean up any spills of blood or blood-tinged body fluid.
Always wear a condom during sex.
Don’t share needles if you do drugs. Always use a clean needle.

Influenza in children,"Influenza in children
Influenza (or “flu”) is a respiratory infection caused by influenza virus. Influenza outbreaks happen every year, usually between November and April. Because influenza viruses change – often from year to year – people don’t stay immune for very long. That’s why people can catch the flu more than once. The term “seasonal flu” is used for the influenza viruses that spread every year.
How does influenza spread?
Influenza viruses are found in the nose and throat. Children can catch influenza from siblings, parents, other family members, playmates or caregivers.
Germs usually spread in one of 3 ways:
Direct contact —such as kissing, touching or holding hands—with an infected person. If you have a virus, you will have germs in your nose, mouth, eyes or on your skin. By touching other people, you can pass on the virus. 
Indirect contact means touching something—a toy, doorknob or a used tissue—that has been touched by an infected person and now has germs on it. Some germs, like the ones that cause colds and diarrhea, can stay on surfaces for many hours. 
Through the air when a person coughs or sneezes. Droplets from the cough or sneeze may reach another person’s nose or mouth.
How do I know if my child has influenza?
The flu strikes more quickly than a cold, and makes people feel worse. Children with colds usually have energy to play and keep up their daily routines. Children with influenza are usually in bed.
Typical influenza symptoms include:
sudden fever,
chills and shakes,
headache,
muscle aches,
extreme fatigue,
dry cough,
sore throat, and
loss of appetite.
Children with the flu may have many of the same symptoms as adults, but there can be differences:
Newborns and babies may have a high fever that can’t be explained, and no other signs of sickness.
Young children usually have temperatures over 39.5°C and may have febrile seizures (convulsions). 
Upset stomach and pain, vomiting, and diarrhea are common in younger children. Earaches and red eyes are also common. 
In some cases, muscle inflammation can lead to severe leg or back pain. 
Can the flu cause any other complications?
Most healthy people recover from the flu without any serious problems. Fever and muscle aches usually last only 2 to 4 days, but cough and tiredness can continue for 1 to 2 weeks or more.
In young children, flu can cause croup (an infection of the throat and vocal cords causing hoarseness, barking cough, noisy breathing), pneumonia (lung infection) and bronchiolitis (infection of the tiny airways that lead to the lungs causing wheezing and difficulty breathing).
Influenza can weaken the immune system, leading to bacterial infections of the ear (otitis), lung (pneumonia) or sinuses (sinusitis).
Influenza is more severe in children under 2 years of age and in children with certain chronic conditions such as heart, lung or neurological problems.
In rare cases, influenza can affect the brain or heart.
What can I do if my child has influenza?
Keep your child as comfortable as possible. Offer plenty of fluids and small, nutritious meals. 
If they have a fever, dress them in lightweight clothing and keep the room temperature around 20°C. 
To ease pain, aches or a fever with a temperature greater than 38.5°C, use acetaminophen. Ibuprofen may be used for children over 6 months old. Unless your doctor says otherwise, give the dose recommended on the package every 4-6 hours until the child’s temperature comes down. Don’t give acetylsalicylic acid (ASA [eg, Aspirin])—or any medicine containing it—to children and teenagers with colds because it can lead to brain and liver damage (Reye syndrome).
Don’t give over-the-counter (OTC) cough and cold medicines to children younger than 6 years old unless your doctor prescribes them.
Gargling with warm water will ease a sore throat. For children 3 years of age or older who can safely suck on hard candy without choking can use sugarless hard candy or lozenges containing honey, herbs or pectin. Throat lozenges containing medications that numb the throat (dyclonine, benzocaine, hexylresorcinol, menthol and phenol) should not be used by young children because they can make it hard for them to swallow.
Antiviral medications
If your child has lung or heart disease, an illness that affects the immune system or some other chronic condition that requires regular medical attention and you think your child may have influenza, call your doctor right away. Your doctor may prescribe an antiviral drug. These drugs may also be prescribed for healthy people with severe influenza. They should be taken within 48 hours of the first symptoms to be most effective.
When should I call my doctor?
Call your doctor or take your baby to an emergency department if your baby is under 3 months of age and:
is having trouble breathing,
is not eating or is vomiting, or 
has a fever (rectal temperature of 38.5°C or higher).
Call your doctor or take your child to an emergency department if your child is:
breathing rapidly or seems to be working hard to breathe,
having chest pain, or is coughing up bloody sputum (phlegm or saliva), 
coughing so bad that they are choking or vomiting,
drinking very little fluid and have not urinated (peed) at least every 6 hours when awake, 
vomiting for more than 4 hours, or has severe diarrhea, 
much sleepier than usual, doesn’t want to feed or play, or is very fussy and cannot be comforted,
not feeling better after 5 days and still has a fever, or was feeling better and suddenly develops a new fever, or showing signs of the flu and has a serious chronic illness. 
Take your child immediately to a hospital emergency department or call 911 if your child:
has severe trouble breathing or blue lips,
is limp or unable to move, 
is hard to wake up or does not respond, 
has a stiff neck, 
seems confused, or 
has a seizure (convulsion). 
How can I prevent the spread of influenza? 
Influenza can be prevented through immunization. Children over 6 months old should get a flu shot each year. 
If there are children younger than 5 years old or someone with a serious chronic condition in your home, everyone living in the house should get a flu shot. This is especially important if there are children under 6 months old in the home, since babies this age can’t get the flu shot themselves and could become infected if a family member gets the flu.  
Handwashing is the most important way to reduce the spread of viruses.
Keep babies under 3 months old away from people who are sick, if possible.
Teach your children to cover their nose and mouth with tissues when they sneeze or cough, or to cough into their upper sleeve or elbow. 
Avoid sharing toys that young children place in their mouths until the toys have been cleaned. 
Avoid sharing cups, utensils or towels until they have been washed.
If your child attends daycare, tell the caregiver about any symptoms and ask if your child should stay home that day.
Make sure your child receives all of the recommended vaccines. They will help prevent some of the complications, such as bacterial infections of the ears or lungs.

Measles,"Measles
Highlights
Measles is very contagious.
You can protect your child by making sure they are vaccinated. 
Call the doctor immediately if you think your child has measles.
What is measles?
Measles is a severe and highly contagious respiratory infection caused by a virus. It is not “an ordinary infection that all children should have.” Sometimes measles is called “red measles” (or rubeola). It should not be confused with “German measles,” which is another name for rubella.
What are the symptoms of measles?
Measles begins with a fever, aches and pains, runny nose, a severe cough (often bronchitis, an infection of the airways) and very red eyes. You may think your child has a cold.
In a few days, a reddish blotchy rash begins around the face and head, then spreads down to the body, arms and legs. Bright light may cause eye pain.
Measles can cause an ear infection or pneumonia (a serious disease where breathing becomes difficult). 
In severe cases, measles can cause swelling of the brain, which is called encephalitis. This can lead to seizures, permanent brain damage, hearing loss, or death.
How does measles spread?
Measles is mainly spread through the air. It can be caught just by being in a room with a person with measles or where someone with measles has been recently. The virus can survive in the air for an hour or more.  
When someone with measles coughs or sneezes, droplets may directly land in another person’s nose or mouth.
Children are very contagious up to 4 days before the rash starts and before the illness is diagnosed.
Measles is very contagious. If you have not been vaccinated or already had measles, you will probably get it if you are in the same room as someone who has it.
When should I call the doctor?
Call the doctor immediately if you think your child has measles. Let the receptionist know if you think your child could have measles. They should not wait in the same room as other children. 
How can I protect my child?
There is no cure for measles. You can protect your child by making sure they are vaccinated.

Meningococcal disease,"Meningococcal disease
Meningococcal diseases are caused by a germ (a kind of bacteria) called meningococcus. This germ can cause two serious diseases:
Meningitis, an infection of the fluid and lining that cover the brain and spinal cord, and
Septicemia, a serious blood infection that can damage organs in the body.
How common are meningococcal diseases?
Not common. In Canada, there are about 200 cases each year. Less than 1 person in every 100,000 gets the disease each year.
The germ-group causing most meningococcal infections in Canada is group B. Others are with A, C, Y, and W135.
How serious are these diseases?
Without treatment, almost all children with meningococcal disease will die or suffer damage that lasts the rest of their lives.
Even with treatment, about 1 in 15 children will die. 
Deafness occurs in 1 to 2% of those who survive meningitis.
Septicemia can kill very quickly, in as little as 6 to 12 hours. Survivors of septicemia may have permanent scarring or require amputation of limbs.
How do meningococcal diseases spread?
The germs that cause meningococcal diseases are spread by those who have the germs living in their nose and throat. This can happen:
When people are in close contact especially when living in the same house (e.g., kissing, coughing or sneezing when others are nearby).   
Through saliva, when people share food or drinks from a cup or can, water bottles, drinking straws, toothbrushes, mouthed toys, mouthguards, or musical instruments with a mouthpiece.
A doctor will often give antibiotics to family members or others who have come into close contact with someone who has meningococcal disease. This helps stop the germs from spreading. Sometimes vaccine is also given.
How is meningococcal disease treated?
Treatment requires antibiotics given by vein.
Fluids are also given by vein, as well as drugs to support blood pressure. A machine may be needed to help breathing. 
How can you tell if your child has meningococcal meningitis?
Early signs may include fever, drowsiness, reduced consciousness (your child doesn’t seem to wake up ), irritability, fussiness (crying) and/or agitation.
Other symptoms include: severe headache, vomiting, stiff neck, pain when moving the head or neck, aches and pains, joint pain, and seizures.
Some children with meningococcal meningitis have a skin rash made up of red spots that don’t disappear when pressed. The spots can get quite large over a short period of time.
How can you tell if your child has meningococcal septicemia?
Early signs are fever, aches and pains, nausea, loss of appetite, joint pain and headache.
Children with this disease get sick within a few hours. They become drowsy, semi-conscious, irritable or agitated.
Almost all children with septicemia have a skin rash that starts as red spots that can happen on any part of the body. The spots increase in size and number in just a few hours.
The disease can move very quickly. Complications include a drop in blood pressure (shock), coma, seizures, and difficulty breathing.
How can I protect my child?
You can protect your child from these diseases with a vaccine.

Mumps,"Mumps
Mumps is a contagious infection caused by a virus. Mumps is most common in children, although sometimes adults get it too.
What are the symptoms?
Mumps causes fever, aches and pains, headaches and swelling of the salivary glands around the jaw and cheeks. This swelling is painful and makes the cheeks puff out. The glands usually become more swollen and painful over 1 to 3 days. Chewing and swallowing can become painful.
Some children infected with mumps have no symptoms at all, or may seem to have a cold, but can still spread the infection to others.
In severe cases, mumps can cause meningitis, a serious disease that infects the fluid around the brain and spinal cord or encephalitis (swelling in the brain). This can lead to seizures, hearing loss, or death.
Older boys and men sometimes get orchitis (painful swelling of the testicles), which can cause sterility (not able to get a woman pregnant).
Women may have a painful infection of the ovaries, but it does not prevent pregnancy.
How does mumps spread?
Mumps spreads through the saliva and secretions from the nose.
The mumps virus passes from person to person through droplets from the nose or throat of someone with mumps. These droplets may land in the nose or mouth of someone who is close by, especially when the infected person coughs or sneezes.
Infection can also be spread through contact with saliva such as kissing, sharing a toy that has been in the mouth, sharing a glass — with an infected person.
How can I protect my child?
Get your child vaccinated.

Pertussis (Whooping cough),"Pertussis (Whooping cough)
Highlights
Pertussis is a very contagious disease.
Anyone who has not been vaccinated against pertussis can become ill with whooping cough. 
Whooping cough is becoming more common among teenagers because the protection from their vaccines has worn off.  
Also called whooping cough, pertussis is caused by germs that get into the throat and lungs and makes it difficult to clear mucous from the airways. Children may cough so long and so hard that they can’t breathe. Young infants may not be able to cough forcefully and may stop breathing.
Babies with whooping cough may have fits (seizures) and in serious cases, go into a coma.  About 1 in 400 infants with pertussis dies because of pneumonia or brain damage.
Older children, adolescents and adults who get whooping cough will have 1 to 2 weeks of frequent severe coughing spells. In total, coughing can last from 6 to 12 weeks.
How does pertussis spread?
Pertussis is a very contagious disease.
It spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes and the germs land in the nose or mouth of someone who is close by.
It usually spreads among family members and in other situations where there is close contact between people.
Pertussis is most contagious during the first 2 weeks, when symptoms are similar to a common cold.
Anyone who has not been vaccinated against pertussis can become ill with whooping cough. The pertussis vaccine does not work as well as other vaccines, and protection wears off after a few years, so even people who have had the vaccine can sometimes get pertussis. However, it is still important to get the vaccine because those who have been vaccinated and still get pertussis will have a much milder disease  than those who have not been vaccinated.
What are the symptoms of pertussis?
Pertussis is also known as “whooping cough” because the main symptom is severe coughing. Coughing may be followed by a “whoop” sound before the next breath.
It usually starts like a cold, with a very runny nose. After a few days, the typical coughing begins. Your child is already contagious when the cold-like symptoms start.
The coughing can be so aggressive that children vomit or have trouble breathing. Many children keep themselves and their families awake because they cough so much in the night.
The cough is usually severe for 2 to 3 weeks and then starts to get better.
Some children will continue to have some coughing for several months after having pertussis, especially if they get a cold before they fully recover.
Whooping cough is becoming more common among teens because the protection from their vaccines has worn off. Older children and teens usually only have a prolonged cough without the “whoop” sound. They can also have trouble breathing, vomit, or experience weight loss.
Can pertussis cause bigger problems?
Yes. Babies with whooping cough may have spells where they don’t breathe or have seizures. In serious cases, they can go into a coma. Infants under 1 year old often have to be hospitalized. Almost all deaths from pertussis happen in children who are under 6 months old.
Older children, teenagers and adults may cough so hard that they break a rib, lose control of their urine, get a hernia or collapse a lung.
How is pertussis treated?
If the illness is discovered early enough, before the coughing spells start, antibiotics may help.
If treatment is started later, antibiotics won’t help. This is because the bacteria have already done their damage. But antibiotics may still be given to prevent the bacteria spreading to someone else.
How can I protect my child?
You can protect your child by making sure they are vaccinated.
Your child will be vaccinated at 2, 4, 6 and 18 months, at age 4 to 6 years, and usually again in adolescence (between 14 and 16 years of age). 
Adults should have one dose in their adult years, especially parents or grandparents of young children and people who work with young children. In most jurisdictions the adolescent and adult doses are provided free of charge.
Because this disease is so severe in very young babies, vaccination of all pregnant women is now recommended. Antibodies produced by the mother are passed to the fetus before birth, protecting the baby for the first few months of life. Young babies can also be protected if everyone around them, including adults, has been appropriately vaccinated, but that does not seem to protect them as well as vaccinating the pregnant mother.
When should I call the doctor?
Take your child to the doctor if you think that they might have whooping cough even if they have already received all scheduled vaccines.
If your child has been exposed to pertussis, they should receive pertussis vaccine as soon as possible if their vaccines are not up to date. Some children exposed to pertussis are given antibiotics. Your doctor or your local public health unit can tell you if your exposed child needs antibiotics.
See your doctor if your child has coughing that:
is followed by vomiting, or
is followed by a whooping sound when your child breathes in after coughing, or
causes breathing problems, or
makes your child’s skin or lips turn red, purple, or blue.

Pneumococcal infections,"Pneumococcal infections
What are pneumococcal infections?
Pneumococcal infections are caused by bacteria (germs) called Streptococcus pneumoniae. These bacteria can cause infections in many different parts of the body, including the:
brain (meningitis)
bloodstream (bacteremia)
lungs (pneumonia)
middle ear (otitis media)
sinuses (sinusitis)
How do pneumococcal infections spread?
The germs spread from the nose and throat through coughing and sneezing when other people are close by. They can also spread through saliva by kissing or sharing things like food, cups, water bottles, straws, toothbrushes, or a musical instrument with a mouthpiece.
Children in child care settings are at greater risk of infection because they are more likely to share mouthed items, such as toys, with other children.
How can you tell if you have a pneumococcal infection?
The symptoms of a pneumococcal infection depend on what part(s) of the body is affected. The diagnosis is made by finding pneumococcus in blood, the infected fluid or tissue.
Meningitis (brain infection)
Meningitis is a serious disease that affects the brain and spinal cord.
Symptoms include high fever, and loss of appetite, stiff neck, headache, vomiting, fussiness (crying), and difficulty waking up (drowsiness). 
Meningitis can cause seizures, deafness or brain damage.
Without treatment, all children who get this disease will die.
Bacteremia (bloodstream infection)
Bacteremia is caused when bacteria get into the blood.
Symptoms include high fever, headache, vomiting, fussiness, and loss of appetite.
If the bacteria multiply rapidly, they may cause shock (sudden severe drop in blood pressure) and damage to many parts of the body. 
Infection may spread from the blood to bone or joints. 
Pneumonia (lung infection)
People with pneumonia have trouble breathing.
Children who get pneumonia from the pneumococcal germ get ill very quickly. 
They will have a fever, a cough, chest pain and may bring up thick yellow or green mucous.
Otitis media (middle ear infection)
Many different germs can cause ear infections. Pneumococcus is the most common cause.     
Middle ear infections usually start a few days after the start of a cold.
They cause ear pain, lack of energy, fussiness, waking up at night, and a lack of appetite. Some children get a fever.
Sinusitis
The sinuses are air-filled spaces in the bone of the face. Pneumococcus is the most common cause of sinusitis.
Sinusitis causes pain and tenderness over the sinuses, and sometimes fever. 
Each of these infections can also be caused by other germs. The pneumococcal vaccine will not protect your child from infections that are caused by another germ.
How are pneumococcal infections treated?
People with serious pneumococcal infections need to take antibiotics to get better. But in some serious infections even with antibiotics, the germ can cause permanent damage. Middle ear infections often go away without antibiotics.
How can I protect my child from pneumococcal infections?
Have your baby vaccinated with the pneumococcal vaccine.

Rotavirus,"Rotavirus
Highlights
Without vaccine, almost all children will have at least one episode of rotavirus diarrhea before they turn 5 years old.
Outbreaks of rotavirus diarrhea in Canada usually happen between December and May.
The illness usually lasts 5 to 7 days.
Rotavirus is the most common cause of serious diarrhea in babies and young children. It usually affects children between the ages of 6 and 24 months of age. Without vaccine, almost all children will have at least one episode of rotavirus diarrhea before they turn 5 years old.
When older children and adults get rotavirus, they have a milder illness. They have less diarrhea and are less likely to become dehydrated.
What are the symptoms?
The first signs are usually fever and vomiting. Within 12 to 24 hours, children start to pass large amounts of watery diarrhea. Severe diarrhea and dehydration are the most common symptoms of rotavirus. Dehydration can happen as soon as 6 hours after the illness starts.
The illness usually lasts 5 to 7 days.
How is rotavirus spread?
When children have rotavirus, their stool contains a large number of the germs. The virus enters the body through the mouth, usually on fingers but sometimes on toys or other objects. The germs spread:
by touching the hands of someone who has the infection.
by touching something that has been touched by a person with the infection, such as toys, furniture or countertops. The germs can survive a long time on surfaces.
Children can spread rotavirus both before and after they develop symptoms. The illness usually starts between 1 and 3 days after someone is exposed to the virus. Children who have been infected once can be infected again. Usually the illness is less severe after the first time.
Outbreaks of rotavirus diarrhea in Canada usually happen between December and May.
How is rotavirus treated?
Because rotavirus is a virus antibiotics will not help. If your child has mild diarrhea, offer plenty of fluids. An oral rehydration solution (a mixture of water, salts and sugar used to prevent dehydration) may be needed if your child’s diarrhea is more serious.
If you are breastfeeding, continue to do so. This will help keep your baby hydrated.
In severe cases, your infant or toddler may need to be treated with intravenous (IV) fluids in a hospital. Call your child’s doctor if you see signs of dehydration:
decreased urination (fewer than 4 wet diapers in 24 hours),
not able to drink, 
vomiting that won’t stop,
no tears, 
dry skin, mouth and tongue, 
faster heartbeat, 
sunken eyes, 
grayish skin, 
sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on the baby’s head. 
How can I prevent rotavirus?
Have your baby vaccinated with the rotavirus vaccine.
Wash your hands and your child’s hands often to help prevent the spread of germs, especially after changing your baby’s diaper.
If your child is vomiting or has diarrhea, inform the day care and ask how long they should stay at home.

Rubella (German measles) in pregnancy,"Rubella (German measles) in pregnancy
What is rubella?
Rubella, commonly known as German measles, is an infection that affects the skin and lymph nodes. It is caused by a virus. Rubella is serious in pregnant women because of the effect it can have on an unborn child.
What are the symptoms of rubella?
When children get rubella, it is usually a mild illness. Sometimes they have no symptoms at all, but they can still spread the infection to others.
Symptoms may include:
A low-grade fever and mild aches and pains, sometimes red eyes. 
A rash of pink or light red spots that start on the face and spread down to the rest of the body.
Neck glands may swell up and feel tender, especially behind the ears.
The sickness lasts about 3 days and generally gets better on its own without any complications. In teens and adults, rubella can be a more serious disease. Joint pain is common. 
How is rubella spread?
The rubella virus passes from person to person through droplets from the nose or throat of someone with rubella. These droplets may land in the nose or mouth of someone who is close by, especially when the infected person coughs or sneezes.
Rubella is most contagious a few days before and after the rash appears.
What about pregnant women and rubella?
Rubella in pregnancy is now very rare in Canada because most women have been vaccinated against it. 
If a pregnant woman gets rubella during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, she usually passes the disease on to her unborn baby. The baby will have congenital rubella. Babies with congenital rubella are contagious for more than a year. 
If the fetus gets rubella during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the baby will likely be born with many life-long problems. The most common are eye problems, hearing problems and damage to the heart.
If the fetus gets rubella between 12 and 20 weeks of pregnancy, problems are usually milder.
There are rarely problems if the fetus gets rubella after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
There is no treatment for rubella infection.
What can you do to prevent rubella while you are pregnant?
If you've had the rubella infection or have been vaccinated, you are likely protected.
If you aren’t sure if you had a rubella vaccine, you should have a blood test before you get pregnant. The test will tell you if you are protected against rubella. 
If a blood test shows you are not protected against rubella, you should get the MMR vaccine right away. The vaccine should be given at least 4 weeks before you become pregnant. You cannot get this vaccine when you are pregnant.
If you are already pregnant and do not know if you are protected against rubella, ask your doctor to test you. If you are not, avoid close contact with people who have rubella, and those who have had a rash for less than a week unless a doctor has told them that the rash is something other than rubella.
If you are not immune, you should be vaccinated as soon as possible after your baby is born, before leaving the hospital.

Genetic testing in children,"Genetic testing in children
What is genetic testing?
Genetic testing can help doctors look for changes in genes that can cause certain medical conditions.
Genes carry information that determines your traits – features or characteristics that are passed on to you from your parents. Some genetic disorders can run in families. Genetic testing can sometimes find if someone has an illness, is at risk of one, and/or is a carrier for an illness.
Genetic testing has risks and benefits. Your health care provider, a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor can talk to you about the pros and cons of testing.
Who is genetic testing for?
People get genetic testing for many reasons. Your health care provider might recommend genetic testing for your child if:
you have a family history of a genetic disease that may require treatment during childhood.
your child has symptoms of a condition that could be linked to a genetic disorder.
Genetic testing to see if a child is a carrier of an illness should be delayed until they are old enough to give their own consent. The exception would be in cases where the test results would change how doctors provide care before the child is old enough to give consent.
Genetic testing to identify conditions that don’t typically appear until adulthood (e.g., some types of cancer, some heart disease, and other single-gene conditions) is generally not recommended during childhood.
How is genetic testing done?
Genetic testing is usually done with a small sample of blood. Sometimes it is done with tissue or saliva. Some tests look for specific variations or examine a limited number of genes. Others look at thousands of genes at the same time.
Should we do genetic testing if my child was adopted?
No. Unless there is a medical reason to test, adopted children should only have genetic testing similar to screens and tests offered to children in the general population. 
What are the risks of genetic testing?
Genetic testing for children can come with psychological and social risks. Any discussion about genetic testing should involve your health care provider, as well as a medical geneticist or a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors help people decide what tests to get and understand what they mean. They can also offer support and resources.
What are the benefits of genetic testing?
Genetic testing can allow doctors to pinpoint a specific diagnosis, which can help them take better care of your child. This can ensure that the right tests are done, and can help avoid unnecessary ones. Having a diagnosis can also help determine the chances of the same condition happening again if you were to have other children.
What about privacy?
Genetic information is private because sometimes people with genetic differences are discriminated against.
What about consent?
Parents must give consent for genetic testing on young children. Parental permission assumes they have their child’s best interest at heart. Older children may give their own consent if they are mature enough to fully understand what they are agreeing to. The legal age of consent is different depending on which province or territory you live in.
Be open with your child and let them participate and make decisions when appropriate.
What about those genetic testing kits I can buy online?
The Canadian Paediatric Society does not recommend the use of at-home genetic testing kits for children, such as those marketed to learn about ancestry or health conditions. For children, the risks far outweigh the benefits.

Helping your teen with special health needs move to adult care,"Helping your teen with special health needs move to adult care
The transition to adulthood is a major life process for young people, which for many, includes a change in their health care providers. For youth with chronic health conditions, this change can cause a range of feelings from fear and worry to uncertainty or excitement.
Some children, teens and their families have spent years receiving care from paediatricians and/or pediatric specialists and healthcare teams. They may have developed strong bonds with health care providers, who can be difficult to leave behind.
Most Canadian children’s hospitals have an age by which patients need to move on, usually between 16 and 18 years old. The process of getting ready for this change should start early and continue even after your teen starts to see their new doctor or health care team. By talking with your teen about this transition early, you will help them see it as a normal, expected part of life.
It will be important for your teen to understand that they can develop a trusting relationship with their new adult health care provider. By working together, you can encourage your teen to take a more active role in their care and understand how to use their new health care services. It is also important for your teen to learn how to manage their condition on a day-to-day basis.
What is the difference between paediatric care and adult health care?
Paediatric care is family-focused, with care suited to your child or teen's developmental stage. Parents are more intensely involved in decision-making when the children are young, with teens being gradually more involved as they mature. It also typically includes a team of professionals who each provide specific expertise.
Adult care tends to be more patient-focused. Patients are usually independent and make their own decisions. Although there is a place for family members in this system, support, decision-making and family involvement is often different from paediatric care.
What should I do to prepare my teen?
Have a positive attitude. If your teen sees the change as a step forward, like a graduation from paediatric care, the change may seem less scary.
Your teen should gradually become more responsible for their health care. Encourage them to practice doing more on their own and offer support.
Encourage your teen to develop a relationship with their family doctor before they have to leave their paediatrician—the earlier the better. In some communities, this may mean seeking out a family physician to assume general care.
Plan to attend appointments with your teen, but let them try to lead the appointment and spend time with their health care providers alone. This process will help them develop the confidence to talk to you and their health care providers, and to make decisions affecting their health. You can participate by listening and offering your support and opinion when appropriate.
Your teen’s health care teams should all be part of the discussion. Each can provide resources to help with the transition. Ask for books, newsletters, magazines and good websites that deal with youth health issues, and information on living with your teen’s health condition.
Help your teen understand their health condition and reasons for treatment. Have open discussions about their illness and how they can fit their health needs into everyday life situations. For example, having to take medications at school, or exercising while at a friend’s house.
Let your teen meet their health care professional on their own for part of the appointment. Teach them the skills they need to talk openly with their new doctor and let them know that they shouldn’t be afraid to ask questions.
Help your teen find information about the things any teen may need to know, including information about resources in your community that provide confidential services related to sexual health, drug and alcohol use or misuse, emotional counseling and educational/career planning. The general pediatrician or family doctor may provide some of these services. In some communities, these services are also offered through community clinics.
Teens will often need extra support, counseling, and education to help them through the transition. Some also benefit from peer support groups. Speak to your teen’s doctor about options.
It is normal for all teens and young adults to wonder about things like their future ability to become pregnant or have healthy children. These questions can be even more important for teens with special health care needs. Assist your teen in bringing up these issues with their doctor, or asking about whether genetic counseling is appropriate.
There are many “apps” that can help people with special health needs track and manage their conditions. Encourage your teen to explore the Internet for options or ask health care providers for their recommendations.
It may be helpful to ask your teen’s doctor for a copy of a transfer letter that summarizes their medical information, current health status, and goals of care. This will help your teen plan visits to their new doctor.
With proper planning, education and practice, your teen will be better able to get the health care they need and have a healthier transition into adulthood.

How to make sure antibiotics are the right choice,"How to make sure antibiotics are the right choice
Sometimes when your child is sick, they will need an antibiotic to get better. Most often, your child will get better just as quickly with or without antibiotics. It’s important to know when your child might need an antibiotic.
What is an infection?
Infections are caused by germs. They are often found on the things we touch and can be passed from others if the germs come into contact with our nose, mouth or eyes. Two common types of germs are viruses and bacteria:
Infections most commonly caused by viruses include colds and influenza (flu), and some ear infections.
Infections caused by bacteria include strep throat, bladder and skin infections, and some ear infections.
What are antibiotics?
Antibiotics are drugs that doctors prescribe to kill infections caused by bacteria. They do not kill viruses. An antibiotic will not help your child get better if they have a virus.
Antivirals are drugs that doctors prescribe to treat some serious infections from viruses such as influenza or chickenpox.
How do antibiotics work?
Antibiotics kill bacteria or stop them from growing and reproducing. There are many different kinds of antibiotics. If your child needs an antibiotic, your doctor will choose the one that’s right for that specific infection.
Some bacteria have become “resistant” to antibiotics. This means the bacteria has changed in a way that makes it more difficult for the drug to cure or prevent the infection. When an infection can’t be treated with the usual antibiotics, sometimes another antibiotic that has not been studied as much, that may have more side effects, and/or that must be given by intravenous (administered into a vein) has to be used.
Why have bacteria become resistant to antibiotics?
Bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics when the drugs are used too often. 
How can you use antibiotics wisely?
Children should only receive an antibiotic to treat an infection that is caused by bacteria. Colds are caused by viruses, and should not be treated with antibiotics. It’s okay to ask your doctor if they think your child’s infection was caused by a virus or bacteria and if an antibiotic is necessary. If your child has the flu, ask if an antiviral agent would help.
When your child is sick, it’s best to see their own doctor. That way, a record of all their medication use will be in one place. Avoid going to different walk-in clinics if you can.
If your child is prescribed antibiotics, be sure to follow the instructions. Discuss the amount of time your child should take it because some types of infections can be treated for shorter time periods.
Never use antibiotics prescribed for someone else.
Never use antibiotics left over from a previous illness. If you have unused antibiotics in your home, you should bring them to the pharmacy for safe disposal.
Make sure your child is immunized. Immunizations, such as the pneumococcal vaccine, help prevent some of the illnesses that antibiotics are used to treat. Vaccines can also prevent many serious viruses, like chickenpox and influenza.

"Making treatment decisions for babies, children and teens","Making treatment decisions for babies, children and teens
Making treatment decisions for a child’s illness can be stressful and difficult. You’re probably already upset that your child is sick or in discomfort, and you may be asked to make decisions quickly.
To ensure your child benefits from treatment, decisions should be made jointly with their health care team and, depending on their age and ability, with your child as well.
Decisions could include:
Choosing between more than one treatment.
Timing: Whether to have treatment now or wait.
Weighing the benefits of treatment(s) against the potential harms of side effects.
In some circumstances, when a cure is unlikely, the decision may include stopping some therapies and/or treatments. If this happens, the priority will be therapies or treatments that keep your child as pain and symptom-free as possible.
Parents (or guardians) are usually the main decision-makers for young children. Here are some things to consider:
If you don’t understand your options, ask questions. If you speak a different language than your health care team, you can ask for help from an interpreter.
Which treatment plan is the best for your child?
Review your choices. How will they affect your child’s lifestyle, health and well-being?
Will your choices be influenced by personal, cultural, moral, spiritual or religious values and beliefs?
What is informed consent?
After you talk to your child’s health care providers (and your child, if appropriate) about all the issues and have come to a decision, you will be asked to give informed consent. In most hospitals, you will be asked to sign a consent form.
Informed consent means you:
understand your child’s medical condition,
understand your choices,
understand the risks and benefits of your choices,
have had the chance to ask questions,
are making a decision of your own free will, and
agree to the treatment.
If you still have questions or concerns, discuss them with your health care providers before you give verbal or written consent.
Older children and teens
As children grow and develop, it’s important to answer their questions truthfully and to include them (in a way that is appropriate to your child’s age and developmental stage) in making decisions about their health and treatment. This may help your child be less afraid and anxious and more likely to trust health care providers.
Eventually, young people will be asked to make their own decisions and provide their own informed consent. This is their legal right, and their health care providers have the responsibility to make sure this happens.
The legal age of consent is different depending on which province or territory you live in. In some places, there is no specific age and it will depend on the young person’s ability to understand and make decisions. Your health care provider should know or be able to find out for you.
End-of-life decisions
Not every child will recover from trauma or illness. Making decisions for a dying child is especially difficult and complex because you are suffering from extreme sadness and grief. If this happens, the goal is always to do what is right for the child and sadly, sometimes the right decision is to not start, or to stop life support and allow your child to die as peacefully as possible.
Your health care providers will try to make your child comfortable and provide relief from symptoms (like pain and shortness of breath) and will talk to you about ways to receive emotional, psychological and spiritual support. This is called palliative and comfort care.
It is very important that you get the help you need in this situation, and to remember that other children will also be confused, very sad and may need special help. If this is the case, speak to your health care provider about your options.
When people disagree
Sometimes, family members will disagree with each other, with your child or with a member of the health care team about what is best for your child. If this happens, ask for help. Some hospitals have people who can help with decision-making and conflict resolution, such as an ethics consultant or patient representative.
You may also want to bring someone you know to a meeting, such as another family member or a member of your religious community. Sometimes it can help to get a second medical opinion or to replace a member of the health care team (though this option may not always be available).
In rare cases, a child’s health care provider may be concerned about the welfare of the child when the treatment decision is not felt to be appropriate. In these cases, the healthcare team is required to consult with a children’s protection agency.
Remember to carefully consider your child’s needs as well as those of your family, but make sure that the needs of your child come first.

Natural health products and children,"Natural health products and children
What are natural health products?
‘Natural health products’ is a term used to describe herbs and other supplements made from natural sources. They are sometimes called “complementary” or “alternative” medicines. They are sold to prevent illness or promote health. There are many different types, including:
vitamins and minerals,
herbal remedies,
homeopathic medicines,
traditional medicines (traditional Chinese medicine, traditional East Indian [Ayurvedic] medicine, etc.),
probiotics, and
amino acids and essential fatty acids.
You can buy natural health products in pharmacies and other stores without a prescription, or you can get them from a care provider.
Are natural health products safe?
Because there are so many different products available to buy, there is no one answer to this question. It is important to remember that just because a product claims it is “natural”, it does not always mean it is safe. Some can be harmful if you take too much, while others can cause side effects or allergic reactions.
It’s also important to remember that even if a product is safe for adults, it may not be safe for children. Children are still growing and developing, and their bodies may respond differently to a product or medicine than an adult’s body.
Can my child take natural health products if they are already taking another medication?
Some natural health products interact with other drugs, even non-prescription drugs. They can make the product more dangerous. This can cause one medication to be less effective because your body eliminates it too quickly, not quickly enough, or because it blocks the medication from doing what is supposed to do. 
Always talk to your child’s doctor before using a natural health product.
Are natural health products regulated in Canada?
Health Canada has a Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate that regulates products for sale in Canada. If you want to know about a specific product, check the label.  Products that have been licensed for sale in Canada will have an 8-digit Natural Product Number (NPN) or Homeopathic Medicine Number (DIN-HM) on the label. An NPN or DIN-HM means that the product has been authorized for sale in Canada and is safe and effective when used according to the instructions on the label.
The Natural and Non-prescription Health Products Directorate of Health Canada regulates products that have a wide margin of safety. It is working to develop labelling on products for children and youth that will help guide parents.
Are nosodes safe and a good alternative to vaccines?
Nosodes are not a substitute for vaccines, and there is no scientific or medical evidence to show they prevent infectious diseases. Sometimes called homeopathic vaccines, nosodes are made using bacteria, viruses, tissue or other material from someone with a particular infection, disease or ailment. The substance is then diluted so much that little or no active ingredients are left in the final product.
Where can I find out about advisories and warnings about natural health products?
Health Canada keeps a listing of recent advisories, warnings and recalls about natural health products.

Paediatricians in Canada: Frequently asked questions,"Paediatricians in Canada: Frequently asked questions
What is a paediatrician?
Paediatricians are doctors who specialize in child and youth health. After medical school, they train for at least 4 more years in the care of babies, children, and youth.
Many paediatricians specialize in a specific area of child and youth health. They are called subspecialists. Some examples are paediatric cardiologists (who focus on heart health), paediatric allergists, neonatologists (who care for sick newborns or premature babies), and developmental paediatricians.
Canadian paediatricians practice in many different ways:
Some paediatricians do “consulting care”. They see patients who were referred to them by other doctors for help to diagnose and treat more serious problems.
Some provide primary care in the community. This means they see children and youth who are both well (for example, at an annual exam) and sick. They are also called community paediatricians, and may work part-time in hospitals.
Many paediatricians, particularly subspecialists, work in hospitals or clinics.
Some teach in medical schools or do clinical research.
Paediatricians can play more than one role. For instance, they may have teaching and hospital duties, as well as an office practice.
What do paediatricians do?
Paediatricians provide a wide range of services for children, youth and their families. One day they might be taking care of a very sick newborn baby, while on another they may be treating a teenager who’s been involved in a car crash.
Most paediatricians do one or more of the following:
Provide primary health care: “Primary care” is the day-to-day work of helping sick children get better and preventing healthy children from getting sick. This includes doing physical exams, diagnosing and treating problems, providing education and advice, and giving vaccines. Paediatricians make sure that children are reaching their milestones, growing and developing as they should. If there is a problem, a paediatrician may decide that a child needs to be seen by another health professional for more specialized care. The role of a primary care paediatrician is different depending on where they work. For example, in Alberta, paediatricians do not give routine vaccinations.
Investigate, diagnose, and manage acute or chronic illness: Many paediatricians take care of children with complex medical needs. These may be long-term disabilities or conditions such as diabetes, cystic fibrosis, asthma, or mental health problems. 
Promote health: To help children stay healthy, paediatricians provide advice on issues such as injury prevention, nutrition, physical activity, and behaviour. They do this in their offices, through the media, and by working with other health care professionals, the public, and governments.
Research and evaluate treatment measures: Research by paediatricians contributes to new ways of treating health problems in babies, children and youth. Paediatricians also evaluate current ways of caring for children and youth to make sure that those methods work best.
Work with other professionals: Paediatricians work with other professionals who care for children, including child protection workers, teachers and psychologists.
Advocate for children and youth: Many paediatricians speak with community and parent groups, write opinion articles in the media, engage in social media and provide advice to politicians so they can make informed decisions about improving health services for children.
Does every child in Canada see a paediatrician?
Most children see a family doctor for their ongoing health care. About 30% to 40% of children visit a paediatrician for primary health. In cities like Ottawa, Toronto and Winnipeg and in the province of Quebec, it’s common for children to see paediatricians for their routine care. But children in British Columbia, Alberta, the Maritimes and areas outside large urban centres see family doctors, who refer children with more complex medical needs to paediatricians.
How do you find a paediatrician?
If you live in an area where paediatricians usually provide primary care, there are a few ways to find one:
Word of mouth: Ask friends and family members with children about their paediatricians.
Provincial colleges: Each province has a college of physicians and surgeons, which grants licenses to doctors to practice. Many of the colleges can help people find doctors accepting new patients. Our Find a Doctor page has links to these services.
Referrals: In some areas, you will need a referral from a family doctor or nurse practitioner to see a paediatrician.
* You may also see the word “pediatrician.” This is the American spelling.

Planning care for children and youth with serious medical conditions,"Planning care for children and youth with serious medical conditions
What is advance care planning?
Many people think that advance care planning is only for patients who are dying. But it is just as important to be clear about your health care goals if your child has a non-life threatening, but serious illness. In both these situations, you will be faced with difficult decisions about which treatments to use.
Advance care planning:
Starts with an open discussion with your child’s doctor about what to expect with your child’s illness.
Includes a discussion of short- and long-term care goals for your child’s medical care, so that you can be clear with your health care team about what you want for your child.
Will include discussions about your choices for treatment.
Can also include writing more formal advance directives.
Why should we do advance care planning?
Talking about advance care plans can bring out scary emotions, such as guilt and fear. Talk to members of your child’s health care team that you trust. It might help you relieve your anxiety and feel more in control during a difficult situation. It’s best for you to fully understand all the choices you have and make an informed decision about what is best for your child before a crisis happens.
What kind of discussions will we have?
Advance care planning can include talking about treatments—things like ventilators (machines that help a person to breathe) to how to manage fatigue. Your decisions can be stated through a verbal agreement, but it may be helpful to have them written out, such as in a letter to your doctor. Any decisions you make should be reviewed regularly, especially if your child’s illness changes in any way.
Who will start the discussion?
Anyone can start this discussion—you, your child, your child’s doctor or any other member of your child’s health care team. Once everyone knows and understands the overall goals of care—such as the use of life-saving therapies or ways to reduce pain—you can talk about treatment options.
Making treatment decisions means weighing the benefits and risks of all your options. Consent is required for treatment decisions, including refusing treatments. There are 3 things needed for consent to be valid:
You must make the decision freely—it is entirely your choice.
You must have enough information to make a choice.
You must understand the information.
Children and youth usually fall into 3 categories in terms of the ability to make their own decisions and give consent:
Children who are too young to participate in discussing their care.
Children who are starting to learn and mature and understand their illness. This is a good time to talk about options with your child and explain what is happening.
Children who are fully able to give consent. This is a child or teen who has not yet reached the age of majority, but who has the maturity and understanding to be able to think about and choose treatments.
Parents are usually the ones to make decisions for their child.
For the first two categories, parents give consent or permission for treatment on behalf of their child.
Older children or youth may give their own consent for treatments or procedures, if they are mature enough to fully understand. Local laws may require children to reach a minimum age before they can give consent.
It is important that you are open with your child about what is happening and let him or her participate in and make decisions when appropriate.
What is an advance directive?
There is a trend to encourage all adults to have advance directives, sometimes called “living wills.” They tell others about their treatment wishes in case they are no longer able to decide for themselves. Advance directives make sure that treatments meet the person’s own needs and wants.
You may wish to do the same for your child, even though it may not be fully recognized in the province or territory you live in. If your child is older, they may want to make some of their own choices. Home care workers and schools can then be told of these directives.
Most provinces/territories in Canada do not have official laws that recognize advance directives made by mature minors legal.

Reducing the danger of infection for children with spleen problems,"Reducing the danger of infection for children with spleen problems
Highlights
Call your child’s doctor right away if you notice any signs of an infection.
Even a low fever (less than 38.5°C) should be discussed with your doctor. 
You and your child’s doctor should develop a medical emergency plan.
The spleen is an organ in the abdomen that helps fight off certain severe infections. If your child has had their spleen removed, was born without a spleen or has a spleen that does not work well, they might have trouble fighting such infections.
Certain vaccines and antibiotics help protect against some, but not all infections in children with spleen problems.
Your doctor will advise you as to whether your child should take antibiotics to prevent infection and for how long. Many children with spleen problems are on penicillin twice per day for years. This is generally safe and can reduce the risk of serious infections.
What should you watch for?
Call your child’s doctor right away if you notice any signs of an infection such as:
fever,
aches,
chills,
sore throat,
vomiting, or
headache.
Even a low fever (less than 38.5°C) should be discussed with your doctor. Serious infections can be hard to diagnose at first because it can come on slowly, but still be very dangerous to a child with spleen problems.
What else can you do?
If your child has had their spleen removed (splenectomy) or has a spleen that doesn’t work properly, they should always wear a MedicAlert bracelet. The bracelet should include information about your child’s condition and any special treatment instructions.
You should develop a medical emergency plan with your child’s doctor. If you will not be able to get medical help right away (such as when you are travelling), your doctor should give you antibiotics to start if your child gets a fever. However, you still need to get medical attention as soon as possible.
In addition to all routine childhood immunizations, your child should get the flu vaccine every year.
Your child may need some vaccines earlier than other children, such as the meningococcal vaccine ACWY, or vaccines that aren’t regularly given to other children, such as meningococcal B vaccine. These vaccines are given to children at higher risk of getting meningococcal infections. Speak to your doctor for more information.
If your child gets a dog or cat bite, they should be started on antibiotics even if the bite is not infected.
Talk to your doctor if your child will be travelling to an area where there is malaria.

Shortage of infant and children’s liquid pain and fever medications,"Shortage of infant and children’s liquid pain and fever medications
Due to an early rise in viral illnesses over the spring and summer of 2022, many pharmacies and stores across Canada are experiencing a temporary shortage of infant and children's liquid acetaminophen and ibuprofen products. Acetaminophen is found in products such as Tylenol, Tempra, and others. Ibuprofen is found in products such as Advil or Motrin.
Health Canada is working hard with companies who supply infant and children’s acetaminophen and ibuprofen products to address this shortage.
Is it true that I will need a prescription to buy acetaminophen or ibuprofen for my child?
You do not need a prescription to purchase liquid acetaminophen and ibuprofen for children. Some pharmacies may be able to use larger bottles to fill requests. A prescription is only recommended so that pharmacists can provide you with the proper dosage and instructions for the medication.
I can’t find any product on the shelves. What can I do?
You can look to see if other forms of children’s acetaminophen and ibuprofen are available, such as chewable tablets or suppositories. Speak to the pharmacist first to ensure you give your child the right product and dose.
If buying products online, make sure you are buying from a credible source and that the product has been approved by Health Canada.
Can I use smaller doses of adult acetaminophen or ibuprofen for my child?
Tablet and capsules (and other solid dosage forms) that are used for adults can be used for children depending on your child’s age, size, and ability to swallow solid medications. In some cases, tablets can be split.
Always speak with a pharmacist about available options that are appropriate and safe for your child.
How long will this shortage last?
Although this is a temporary shortage as companies increase their production, it is not known how long it will last. 
Only buy what you need, so that all parents and caregivers can access medication when they need it.
Is there anything else I can do?
Ensure that all your child’s vaccines are up to date, including the COVID-19 vaccine and the flu vaccine, to keep them as healthy as possible. Wash your hands often, stay home when sick, and wear a mask in crowded public spaces.

Supporting your child through a brief medical procedure,"Supporting your child through a brief medical procedure
Medical procedures can be upsetting and stressful for you and your child. These procedures can include getting an intravenous (IV) line for fluid or medication, having a blood or urine test, having a wound or fracture repaired, and getting medical imaging (e.g. x-ray, MRI, CT scan). Some procedures can be painful.

There are simple ways to help your child get through these procedures.
Before the procedure
Prepare yourself and your child.
Tell your child where you are going, who they will meet, and how they are going to help them.
Try to stay calm. Be positive and use your normal speaking voice.
Bring some toys and books. When possible, let your child hold their favourite one during the procedure. If you didn’t bring any, ask if toys or books are available.
While waiting, distract your child by putting on their favorite music, or talk about their favorite activities or a recent fun event.
Be proactive.
For uncomfortable childhood illnesses and conditions, treat your child’s pain with acetaminophen (i.e. Tylenol®, Tempra®) or ibuprofen (i.e. Advil®, Motrin®) if they have no medical contraindications. If your child is under 6 months of age, acetaminophen is recommended. If you suspect a broken bone or sprain and your child is over 6 months of age, ibuprofen is preferred, if your child has no contraindications to this medicine. Otherwise, use acetaminophen. This will make it easier for the medical team to diagnose and help your child. 
For vaccines, do not give your child ibuprofen or acetaminophen before or around the time of vaccination as it does not prevent the pain of injection and it could have an impact on how well the vaccine works. These medications can be used to treat fever, pain, or other bothersome side effects if they develop after vaccination.
Before a needle, ask if a numbing cream would be appropriate. This can lessen the pain related to needles for blood work, vaccines, and intravenous lines. Skin cooling spray can sometimes be used in children over 3 years old.
If you child needs a finger prick (i.e. for a rapid blood sugar measurement), warm your child’s fingers in the waiting room.
If your child is breastfeeding, ask if you can nurse your baby before, during, and after the needle is given. This helps lessen their pain and stress.
If your child is less than a year old, ask if sucrose (sugar water) is available. Sucrose can help lessen the pain of needle procedures, and often works even better if it used along with a soother. Begin to give the sugar water 2 minutes before the needle. Continue giving the sugar drops during the procedure. If your hospital or clinic doesn’t have any pre-made sugar drops, they can be made by mixing 1 teaspoon of granulated white sugar with 2 teaspoons of water.
If your child is experiencing severe anxiety about an upcoming procedure, you might need extra help. Some hospitals have experts (Child Life Specialists) who can help a child feel less scared and more in control when they need to have a medical procedure.
Sometimes procedures can be avoided.
If your child has a stomach flu or another viral infection, encourage them to drink fluid to lessen the chances that they will need an intravenous line for dehydration.
If your baby requires a sterile (clean) urine test, a technique that does not require a catheter is sometimes possible. Ask your health care provider if it would be appropriate for your child.
Some cuts can be treated with medical glue rather than stiches. Talk to your healthcare provider for advice.
During the procedure
Help your child stay in a comfortable position.
For many procedures, younger children can sit on your lap, using a hugging hold. Older children can sit on their own, rather than lay down on a hospital bed.
Babies can be held in a ‘’kangaroo position’’ on your chest or wrapped securely in a blanket.
Distract your child. Distraction can reduce your child’s stress and make them feel better.
Tell a story. Bring them into an imaginary world.
Discuss a nice activity that your child enjoyed, to remind them of a happy place.
Play a “search and find” game or their favourite game.
Play music, sing together, sing a song to your child.
Show them a video on your phone or on your tablet.
Use relaxation techniques with older children.
Encourage your child to take deep breaths and to exhale slowly.
Let them blow bubbles or a use a pinwheel.
Avoid words that could be confusing to your child.
Stay calm and relaxed and use a soothing voice.
Avoid saying ‘‘It’s over’’ when the procedure is ongoing.
Avoid saying ‘‘I’m sorry’’. You are doing what’s best for your child.
Use encouragement and humour.  
After the procedure
Help your child focus on other things.
Cuddle, rock and/or breastfeed your baby. Cuddle your older child.
Comfort your child with their favourite toy, teddy bear or blanket.
Engage your child by playing, talking, reading together.
Remind older children that this will make them get better.
If you give your child a treat after a procedure, explain that it as a celebration of what your child did well (and not as an “I’m sorry” gift).

Using over-the-counter drugs to treat cold symptoms,"Using over-the-counter drugs to treat cold symptoms
What are over-the-counter drugs?
Over-the-counter (OTC) drugs are sold in pharmacies and other stores without a doctor’s prescription. They are often used for common cold symptoms, such as a runny nose, congestion, sore throat, headache, or cough.
But just because they are easy to get doesn’t mean that they always work, or that they are safe. The best treatment for a cold is still plenty of rest and liquids.
Do not give cough and cold medications to babies and children under 6 years old without first talking to your health care provider. The only exceptions are drugs used to treat fever (such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen).
Should I use OTC medications when my child has a cold?
When your child is sick, you want them to feel better. Many parents turn to over-the-counter cough and cold medicines for help. Except for pain and fever drugs, like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, there is no proof that they work. In fact, some of the side effects can make your child feel worse.
There is also a risk of giving your child too much medicine, such as acetaminophen on top of a cough syrup that already contains acetaminophen. Never use more than one product at the same time unless advised by your health care provider.
What are the common OTC medications?
Cough and cold medications
It can be stressful when a cough keeps your child awake at night. But coughing can be helpful. It can be a sign that the body is getting rid of mucus that irritates the airway. Syrups that stop this normal response of the body can be harmful to children.
Many OTC cough-and-cold products contain drugs that claim to ease coughing. Usually, they include dextromethorphan (also called DM) and/or diphenhydramine that reduce the cough reflex. 
Some OTC drugs contain codeine. Codeine should not be used in children under the age of 12 for any reason.
Always check the label first to make sure the medication is suitable for your child. Talk to your health care provider (e.g. doctor, pharmacist, nurse, etc.) if you have any questions about using cough and cold medicines in children. These professionals can also help make sure these medications won’t interfere with other health products your child may be taking.
Decongestants
Oral decongestants (pills or syrups taken by the mouth) are drugs from the same family as adrenaline. They are given to reduce swelling and stuffiness in the nose due to colds.
Decongestants can offer some relief, but they won’t cure the problem and can cause a fast heartbeat, restlessness, or insomnia (not able to sleep) in children.
Antihistamines
Antihistamines are usually used to dry up a runny nose or reduce sneezing caused by allergies.
They can also ease itching from things like hives, chickenpox or insect bites.
Antihistamines won’t help someone with a cold. They can actually cause side effects, such as drowsiness, if used for the treatment of a cold.
Nasal drops or sprays
Nose drops or nose sprays that contain normal saline (a weak salt water solution) can be used to soften the mucus in the nose and help your child breathe better.
Do not use nasal drops or sprays that contain drugs.
You should not use hypertonic (3% or extra strong) nasal drops without talking to your doctor.
Pain and fever relievers
The most common OTC pain relievers are acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), acetaminophen and ibuprofen.
Products with acetylsalicylic acid (such as Aspirin) should not be given to children and teenagers for fever from colds, chickenpox and influenza (flu) because it can cause Reyes syndrome, a sickness that can cause brain and liver damage.
For fever and mild to moderate pain in children, you should use acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Acetaminophen is found in products such as Tylenol, Tempra, and others. Ibuprofen is found in products such as Advil or Motrin. They come in drops for infants, liquid for toddlers, and chewable tablets for older children.
Ibuprofen should only be given if your child is drinking reasonably well.
Do not give ibuprofen to babies under 6 months without first talking to your health care provider.
Do not use ibuprofen or acetaminophen with any other pain reliever or fever reducer, unless your health care provider advises. Remember that some cold medicines include these products with other drugs.
Be sure to read labels carefully to see what the products contain so that you don’t give your child a double dose of the same drug. Different medications have different amounts of acetaminophen, for example. These drugs are generally safe and they do help ease pain and fever, but taking too much can be harmful.
Medication is not always needed to reduce a child’s temperature.
Talk to your doctor if your baby (under 6 months) has a fever. 
Natural health products
“Natural” doesn’t always mean safe. Some substances can be harmful if you take too much of them, while others can cause side effects or allergic reactions. 
Even if a product is safe for adults, it may not be safe for children. Most, if not all, “natural health products” have never been tested for safety or effectiveness in children or adults. 
Children are still growing and developing, and their bodies may respond differently to a product or medicine.
Natural health products can interact with other drugs, even nonprescription drugs.
Talk to your child’s health care provider before you give a natural health product.
What should I do if my child has a cold?
Offer plenty of fluids and encourage your child to rest. Colds are caused by viruses that cannot be cured with drugs. They simply need to run their course, so there is little your doctor can offer. However, more serious problems can start out as a cold.
Contact your doctor if your child shows any of the following signs:
earache
fever lasting more than 72 hours, or, any fever in a child less than 6 months of age
excessive sleepiness, crankiness or fussiness
trouble breathing
less urination (peeing)
coughing that lasts more than a week or is causing choking or vomiting

When your child needs a red blood cell transfusion,"When your child needs a red blood cell transfusion
Highlights
A transfusion can help a person recover from a serious illness, surgery or injury.
Before it is used, blood is tested and divided into separate parts or units.
If your child needs a transfusion they will get only the part that they need.
Blood donors are carefully screened and their blood is tested.
What is a transfusion?
Human blood can be used to make more than 30 different products. Putting some or all of these blood products into someone’s body is called a transfusion. The blood product is usually given through a small needle placed into a vein.
Why would a child need a transfusion?
Newborn babies sometimes need transfusions if they were born prematurely (before their due date).
Your child may need a transfusion during major surgery or to treat a medical condition. Sometimes in emergency situations, such as when there has been sudden bleeding, transfusions have to be given. They can also help a person recover from a serious illness or injury. 
Sometimes, people need more than one transfusion because they are missing important parts of their blood.
What are the parts of blood and what do they do?
Red blood cells carry oxygen to all tissues in the body so that they stay alive and work well. If your child has had a lot of bleeding, or is not making enough red blood cells or hemoglobin (also known as anemia), they may need a red blood cell transfusion. This helps prevent more damage.
Platelets are very tiny cell particles that help prevent and stop bleeding.
Plasma is the yellow liquid around the red blood cells and platelets.
Plasma helps blood clot (become thick). It can be used with platelets to prevent or stop bleeding, or to replace the plasma in children with certain severe diseases.
Other products can be made from plasma and can be used to treat special bleeding problems, such as hemophilia.
Plasma is also used to make a product called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG).This helps the body fight infection and is used to treat many medical conditions.
Other blood products are used in very specific cases. If your child needs them, your doctor will discuss them with you in detail.
Where does donated blood come from?
Canadian Blood Services and Héma-Québec collect blood from volunteer donors. Before it’s used, blood is tested and divided into separate parts or units. If your child needs a transfusion, they will get only the part that they need.
Are there risks to having a blood transfusion?
Some problems can happen from a blood transfusion:
Mismatch of blood types between donor and the person receiving the donation. This is now very rare, especially in children. Special kinds of blood products that are a match for almost everyone are kept for emergency transfusions.
Allergic reactions, including rashes and hives. They are usually mild and easily treated. More serious allergic reactions are rare.
A fever usually means the body is reacting to white blood cells or plasma proteins from the donor’s blood. The fever is usually not severe and can be easily treated. If your child has had a high fever in the past after or during a transfusion, you should talk to the doctor.
Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a rare but serious problem that affects the lungs. It starts with shortness of breath and low oxygen levels in the blood and lungs. This reaction starts quickly, either during the transfusion or within 6 hours of completing the transfusion.
Can my child get a disease from a transfusion?
Although blood can never be 100% safe, blood donors are carefully screened and their blood is tested. The risk of infection from a transfusion is very low.
The risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has dropped to 1 in every 21 million transfusions in Canada.
The risk of hepatitis B infection from a transfusion is 1 in 7.5 million transfusions in Canada.
The risk of getting hepatitis C is even smaller now that a new test can find the virus right in the blood (less than 1 in 12.6 million transfusions).
For products made from plasma (such as albumin and immunoglobulin), there are extra steps taken to get rid of any viruses that may remain after testing.
Does my child have to receive blood from an unknown person?
That is what usually happens and is generally very safe. Sometimes one of the following is also an option:
Autologous blood donation means that the patient donates their own blood before surgery. This has been done safely with children, elderly people, pregnant women and even people with heart disease. It is not an option for everyone. Very small children and those with certain medical conditions cannot give their own blood.
Occasionally, parents can do a directed donation of blood to be used only for their child. However, there are often reasons why this is not the best choice. Ask your doctor about the risks and benefits, and whether this choice is possible. Like all blood donors, you will need to be tested to find out if you are a suitable donor.
There may be alternatives to transfusion, such as the use of saline or nonplasma-derived clotting factor concentrates made with new DNA technology, or other manufactured products. There are also procedures, such as blood salvaging, which may be an option for your child in certain situations. It is important to discuss the details with your child’s doctor.
How do I decide about a transfusion?
As long as it isn’t an emergency situation, your doctor or another health professional will explain why a transfusion is needed, what components of blood are needed, and the risks and benefits. This is called informed process. You will be asked to sign an informed consent form.
Should a blood transfusion record be kept?
Yes. A record will be kept in the hospital, but before you leave, make sure you receive something in writing that says your child received blood or blood products. This is important medical information that should be kept with your child’s health information.

You and your child's doctor,"You and your child's doctor
When your baby is born, you will start taking them to see a primary care provider (a health professional who provides day-to-day health care and advice) for their health care. Your primary care provider can be a paediatrician, family doctor, nurse or midwife. As your child grows and develops, you’ll likely turn to your child’s primary care provider – with questions or concerns.
Should my child see a paediatrician or a family doctor?
Both paediatricians and family doctors provide care for babies, children and teens. They do routine care (check-ups, immunizations, and so on) and see children when they are sick.
In some towns or provinces, all routine care is provided by a family doctor or a nurse practitioner, while in other places, children see a paediatrician for their regular care. Your family doctor might refer your child to a paediatrician for a specific health issue, but they will continue to be involved in care.
How do I find a doctor?
Word of mouth: Ask friends and family members with chil­dren about their doctor.
Provincial colleges and territorial ministries: Each province has a college of phys­icians and surgeons, which grants licenses to doctors to practice. Many colleges have referral services to help people find doctors accepting new patients. In the territories, this service is usually provided by the Ministry of Health.
What will my child’s doctor do?
Keep track of your child’s health, growth and development.
Diagnose, explain and treat minor to more serious illnesses.
Provide information and answer questions.
Send you to other health professionals when an illness or condition may need specialized expertise or services.
When should I take my baby for a first doctor’s visit?
Babies are usually checked by a health care provider within the first week of going home from the hospital. At this first visit your health care provider will:
Weigh your baby and measure their length and head circumference.
Check for signs of jaundice.
Check on how feeding is going for you and your baby.
Do a general physical exam.
Ask how the family is adjusting.
Complete any screening tests that were not done at the hospital.
This first visit doesn’t have to be with your regular paediatrician or family doctor. Sometimes it is done by a doctor at the hospital where you gave birth, your midwife or a public health nurse. It can be done at home, in the office or in a hospital clinic. If your baby doesn’t see their regular doctor at this visit, it will happen soon after.
What can I expect from a visit to my child’s doctor?
“Well-baby” or “well-child” visits are a lot like an adult’s annual check-ups, but focus on your child’s age and stage of development.
Your baby should have regular visits to the doctor at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months, 2 years, and then once every year until 5 years of age. When your child is 5 years old, they should see the doctor every 1 or 2 years until 18 years old.
A well-baby/child visit usually lasts 10 to 20 minutes. Your doctor and the staff will:
Check your child’s weight, height and head circumference.
Discuss your child’s eating habits and answer any questions about nutrition and physical activity.
Provide advice about safety and other issues related to your child’s age and abilities such as when to switch to a forward-facing car seat.
Ask about milestones, such as self-feeding or toilet learning.
Ask about your child’s social and emotional development, such as learning words. When your child gets older, this is a good time to discuss any learning problems in school and any social or emotional issues. You might also want to discuss any problems that are happening at home.
Do a physical exam, such as looking at eyes and ears and listening to your child’s heart.
Give your child any recommended vaccines.
See an older child and adolescents without a parent or guardian in the room for part of the visit.
If you have questions or concerns that could take longer than the regular 15 minute visit, let your doctor’s staff know when you schedule the appointment. That way, enough time can be scheduled to answer your concerns.
How can I make the most of our visit to the doctor?
Keep a list of any concerns you have. Bring it with you so you remember to discuss them at your visit.
Record any symptoms your child may be having. All symptoms are important when talking about health issues.
Bring a list of your child’s medications.
Bring your child’s immunization record.
Involve your child in the visit, both before and during. Talk to them about it before you go, so they know what to expect. If they are old enough, ask them to tell you and the doctor how they're feeling.
How can I make the visit easier for my child?
Schedule visits at a time when your child isn’t usually napping.
Use a toy doctor’s kit to teach your young child about all the things the doctor will do when you visit. Or bring along a favourite “buddy,” a stuffed animal or doll, who gets an exam along with your child. This might help them feel more comfortable when it comes time for the real thing.
Young children may find it difficult to sit still in a doctor’s waiting room. Bring a couple of books, a favourite toy and a snack to help keep your child busy and happy during the wait.
If your child is older, explain why they are visiting the doctor. Use simple, easy-to-understand language. If it is for a regular check-up, explain that all children see a doctor, and that the doctor checks how they are growing and developing. Be honest about what your child can expect from the exam.
Tell your older child or teen that they can see the doctor without you in the room. This might help them feel more comfortable talking with the doctor.
What do I do between visits?
If you have any questions about your child’s health between regular office visits, call your doctor’s office. Your doctor’s receptionist or nurse will be able to help you with minor problems and decide if you need to see the doctor.
Most provinces and territories have toll-free health lines where you can speak to a registered nurse about general health informa­tion. Nurses can help you assess your child’s symptoms and decide your best first step.
