Abdominal pain,"What is abdominal pain?
Abdominal pain is any pain felt between your chest and groin. This is often referred to as the stomach region or belly. Pain can originate from any of the many organs within the abdomen, including:
Digestive organs (the end of the esophagus, the stomach, the small and large intestines, the liver, the gallbladder and the pancreas)
The aorta
The appendix
The kidneys
The spleen
However, the pain may start from somewhere else, like your chest or pelvic area. You may also have a generalized infection, such as the flu or strep throat, that affects many parts of your body.
Symptoms
Pain in the abdominal area.
Diagnosis
Many different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when to seek medical care. Any of the following may cause abdominal pain:
Appendicitis
Bowel obstruction
Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder) with or without gallstones
Chronic constipation 
Dissecting abdominal aortic aneurysm
Diverticular disease, including diverticulitis
Early-stage shingles (a viral infection where pain begins before the appearance of a rash)
Excessive gas
Food allergy
Food poisoning (salmonella, shigella)
Gastroesophageal reflux 
Heartburn or indigestion
Hernia
Infectious mononucleosis
Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis) 
Intussusception (While uncommon, this is a serious possible cause of pain in an infant who may be bringing the knees to the chest and crying.)
Irritable bowel syndrome 
Kidney stones
Lactose intolerance
Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)
Parasitic infections (Giardia)
Sickle cell crisis
Spinal fracture
Ulcers
Urinary tract infections
Viral gastroenteritis (stomach flu)
Diagnostic tests may include:
Barium enema
Upper gastrointestinal (GI) and small bowel series
Blood, urine and stool tests
Endoscopy of upper GI tract (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or EGD)
Ultrasound of the abdomen
X-rays of the abdomen
In infants, prolonged unexplained crying (often called colic) may be caused by abdominal pain that may end with the passage of gas or stool. Colic is often worse in the evening. Cuddling and rocking the child may bring some relief.
Treatment
Seek immediate medical help if your child:
Is unable to pass stool, especially with vomiting
Is vomiting blood or has blood in his or her stool (especially if maroon or dark, tarry black)
Has chest, neck or shoulder pain
Has sudden, sharp abdominal pain
Has pain in his or her shoulder blades with nausea
Belly is rigid, hard and tender to touch
Call the doctor if your child has:
Abdominal discomfort that lasts one week or longer
Bloating that persists for more than two days
Burning sensation when you urinate or frequent urination
Diarrhea for more than five days, or if your infant or child has diarrhea for more than two days or vomiting for more than 12 hours (Call right away if a baby younger than three months has diarrhea or vomiting.)
Fever over 100.4 degrees Farhenheit with pain
Prolonged poor appetite
Unexplained weight loss "
ACL injury,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
ACL injuries are more common among girls than boys.
Treatment for ACL injuries in children requires special consideration because of the location of growth plates.
ACL injuries are classified by grades 1, 2, and 3.
Depending on the grade of ACL injury, the patient’s age, and level of athleticism, non-operative or surgical treatments may be recommended."
Acne,"What is acne?
Acne is a disorder of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands. Hair follicles are the areas around the base or root of each hair. Sebaceous glands are the tiny glands that release oil (sebum) into the hair follicles. The sebum moistens the skin and hair. The sebum and hair get to the skin surface through tiny holes called pores. 
Acne is very common. Most children and young adults between ages 11 and 30 will have acne at some point. Acne most often begins in puberty. But it can happen at any age. There are different types of acne that affect newborns, infants, younger children, and adults. 
Acne may occur when the pores gets clogged with dead skin cells and oil. Bacteria that are normally on the skin may also get into the clogged pore. Acne comes in several types. One type is a comedone. This is a plug of sebum in the hair follicle. They are either closed whiteheads, or open blackheads. These are not inflamed or infected.
Inflamed acne causes red, painful bumps or sores. The sores may be infected with bacteria. This type of acne includes:
Pustule: Bacteria cause the hair follicle to be inflamed. Pustules are closer to the skin surface.
Papule: The wall of the hair follicle gets irritated. Papules are deeper in the skin.
Nodule: These are larger, deeper, and more solid.
Cyst: This is a nodule with pus.
What causes acne?
The cause of acne is not fully understood. Acne is linked with:
Hormonal changes during puberty, pregnancy, and the menstrual cycle
Rising levels of male sex hormones (androgens) in both boys and girls during puberty that causes more sebum and more dead skin cells
Using makeup or cosmetics that block the pores
Using certain products to wash the skin
Wearing clothes that rub or irritate the skin
High levels of moisture in the air (humidity) and sweating
Taking certain medicines, such as corticosteroids    
Who is at risk for acne?
Being a teen (adolescent) is the greatest risk factor for acne. A family history also increases the risk for severe acne.
What are the symptoms of acne?
Acne can occur anywhere on the body. It is most common in areas where there are more sebaceous glands, such as:
Face
Chest
Upper back
Shoulders
Neck
Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each child. They can include:
Small bumps that are skin-colored or white (whiteheads)
Small bumps that are dark in color (blackheads)
Red, pus-filled pimples that may hurt
Solid, raised bumps (nodules)
Darker areas of skin
Scarring
The symptoms of acne can be like other health conditions. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is acne diagnosed?
The healthcare provider will ask about your child’s symptoms and health history. He or she will look at the areas of the body with acne. The provider may advise that your child see a doctor who specializes in skin care (dermatologist).
How is acne treated?
Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The goal of acne treatment is to improve the skins appearance and to lessen the chance of scarring. Treatment for acne will include gentle, regular skin care. Your child's healthcare provider may advise:
Non-prescription cleansers and creams, lotions, gels, or other products
Prescriptions that are put on the skin (topical) or taken by mouth (oral)
Other therapies or procedures, such as laser therapy, light therapy, or chemical peels
Draining of a cyst, or injecting it with medicine
Topical medicines are often prescribed to treat acne. These can be in the form of a cream, gel, lotion, or liquid. These may include:
Benzoyl peroxide: This kills bacteria.
Antibiotics: These help stop or slow down the growth of bacteria. They also reduce inflammation.
Tretinoin: This stops new comedones from forming. It also encourages new skin cell growth and unplugs pimples.
Adapalene: This helps stop new comedones from forming.
Medicines to take by mouth may be prescribed, such as:
Antibiotic medicines: These may include tetracycline, doxycycline, or erythromycin. They are used to treat moderate to severe acne. 
Isotretinoin: This may be prescribed for severe acne that can’t be treated by other methods. It helps to prevent new acne and scarring.
What are possible complications of acne?
Acne can cause problems with self-esteem. It may cause emotional problems. It may result in depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts. Severe or long-term acne may cause scarring. Serious infections may also develop.
Living with acne
Acne can be a long-term condition. Early treatment can help to prevent or lessen severe acne. Help your child by:
Reminding your child to not pick, pop, or squeeze acne, which can spread infection and cause scars
Talking with your child's healthcare provider if over-the-counter treatments don’t work well
Considering taking your child to a dermatologist for long-term or severe acne
Making sure your child stops acne treatment slowly, not quickly, once acne clears
Having your child treat acne a few times a week to prevent it from returning, if needed
Making sure your child does skin care regularly and gently
When should I call my child's healthcare provider?
Call your child's healthcare provider if: 
Your child is upset by his or her acne
The acne is getting worse
Over-the-counter treatments are not working
Key points about acne
Acne is a disorder of the hair follicles and sebaceous glands.
Acne may happen when the pores gets clogged with dead skin cells and oil. Bacteria that are normally on the skin may also get into the clogged pore.
Most teens and young adults between 11 and 30 years old will have acne at some point.
Both over-the-counter and prescription medicines are available to treat acne.
Acne can have an emotional effect. This can lead to depression, anxiety, and even suicidal thoughts.
Scarring can result from severe or long-term acne.
Next steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Acute liver failure,"Acute Liver Failure
This alarming syndrome usually occurs in a previously well infant, child or adolescent and can be caused by a number of infectious or metabolic causes and reactions to medication.
Jaundice occurs rapidly, often in concert with gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and fever.
We are committed to serving children with this disorder as soon as we are notified and work with our emergency transport team, intensive care specialists and if necessary, our pediatric liver surgeons to provide 24-hour care for the best outcome possible for children with this condition.
What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an inherited disease in which a protein known as A1AT is unable to be released from the liver into the blood in adequate amounts. This causes a deficiency of the A1AT protein in the circulation. A1AT is a specialized protein that blocks the action of other proteins important in inflammation (swelling) and breakdown of tissues in the body. When the A1AT protein is deficient in the circulation, tissue inflammation and tissue damage is more severe, especially in the lungs. The defective A1AT protein that remains in the liver may cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) that can progress to cirrhosis (permanent liver scarring) and liver failure.
A1AT deficiency is quite common, with about 1 in 1,500 to 2,000 people affected. Both parents must be carriers of the genetic defect to have a child with A1AT deficiency. Although carrier parents partially produce the abnormal A1AT protein, they usually have no — or very minimal — symptoms and they may not realize they are partially affected until their child is diagnosed with the condition.
Symptoms
About 10 percent of newborns with liver disease will be diagnosed with A1AT deficiency. Newborns may develop jaundice as part of inflammation of the liver associated with A1AT deficiency. Older children and teens can present with a liver that has been inflamed for a long time, causing scarring (cirrhosis) to develop. Lung disease usually develops only in adulthood. Adults with A1AT deficiency may have difficulties with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, coughing and repeated lung infections.
Diagnosis
Testing is usually done when a child has liver inflammation of uncertain cause or when a family history suggests A1AT liver disease. The standard screening test is to measure the amount of A1AT protein in the circulation. In cases of A1AT deficiency, the serum A1AT level will be low. When a low A1AT level is found, an additional test is usually done to identify the types of abnormal A1AT proteins that are in the circulation. In rare cases, a more detailed analysis of the DNA in the gene may be necessary.
The amount of liver swelling and damage can be assessed by ultrasonography (sonogram) of the abdomen, blood tests of liver inflammation and function and a liver biopsy, where a small piece of liver tissue is obtained and then examined under the microscope to search for changes typical of A1AT deficiency.
Treatment
There is no cure for A1AT deficiency. Therapy involves controlling symptoms and attempting to prevent the development of complications. To protect their lungs, it is very important that the affected person and those around them not smoke. Vaccinations to protect against viruses, such as hepatitis A and hepatitis B, that can further damage the liver should be given. It is difficult to predict how severely a liver will be affected. Liver function tests are followed over time. Some patients may have minimal liver disease during their entire lifetime; however, a small number will eventually require liver transplant.
Cirrhosis or Chronic Liver Failure
Cirrhosis or chronic liver failure can be caused by a number of the liver and biliary diseases listed in Clinical Services or sometimes appear without known cause. Our approach to pediatric patients with this problem is to start with a thorough history and physical examination and nutritional assessment.
We also have a frank discussion with the patient and family about what is involved in the evaluation for a life-saving liver transplant.
Liver Cyst or Tumor
There are multiple benign and malignant malformations or tumors that can occur in the liver of a child.
Our approach begins with a thorough review of medical records and imaging studies. We work closely with our interventional radiologists and surgeons to establish an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible.
If the diagnosis is a malignant tumor, then we work with the pediatric oncologists and pediatric surgeons to decide the very best approach, which may include chemotherapy, radiation, embolization, surgical removal and/or liver transplantation."
Achondroplasia,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Achondroplasia is the most common form of skeletal dysplasia, occurring in about one in every 40,000 births.
Achondroplasia impairs the growth of bone in the limbs and causes abnormal growth in the spine and skull.
Although the cause is a genetic mutation, only about one out of five cases is hereditary (passed down by a parent)."
Acute rheumatic fever,"What is acute rheumatic fever?
Rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease that may develop after an infection with a streptococcus bacteria (such as in strep throat or scarlet fever). The disease can affect the joints, heart, skin and brain. 
Symptoms
Symptoms include: 
Fever
Joint pain, arthritis
Joint swelling, redness
Abdominal pain
Skin rash
Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires careful clinical evaluation, including possible blood screening for recurrent strep infection. 
Treatment
Anti-inflammatory medications, such as aspirin or corticosteroids, reduce inflammation to help manage the disease. Patients who test positive for strep throat should be treated with antibiotics."
ADHD,"What is ADHD?
ADHD, also called attention-deficit disorder, is a behavior disorder, usually first diagnosed in childhood, that is characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and, in some cases, hyperactivity. These symptoms usually occur together; however, one may occur without the other(s).
The symptoms of hyperactivity, when present, are almost always apparent by the age of 7 and may be present in very young preschoolers. Inattention or attention-deficit may not be evident until a child faces the expectations of elementary school.
What are the different types of ADHD?
Three major types of ADHD include the following:
ADHD, combined type. This, the most common type of ADHD, is characterized by impulsive and hyperactive behaviors as well as inattention and distractibility.
ADHD, impulsive/hyperactive type. This, the least common type of ADHD, is characterized by impulsive and hyperactive behaviors without inattention and distractibility.
ADHD, inattentive and distractible type. This type of ADHD is characterized predominately by inattention and distractibility without hyperactivity.
What causes attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?
ADHD is one of the most researched areas in child and adolescent mental health. However, the precise cause of the disorder is still unknown. Available evidence suggests that ADHD is genetic. It is a brain-based biological disorder. Low levels of dopamine (a brain chemical), which is a neurotransmitter (a type of brain chemical), are found in children with ADHD. Brain imaging studies using PET scanners (positron emission tomography; a form of brain imaging that makes it possible to observe the human brain at work) show that brain metabolism in children with ADHD is lower in the areas of the brain that control attention, social judgment, and movement.
Who is affected by attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?
Estimates suggest that about 4% to 12% of children have ADHD. Boys are 2 to 3 times more likely to have ADHD of the hyperactive or combined type than girls.
Many parents of children with ADHD experienced symptoms of ADHD when they were younger. ADHD is commonly found in brothers and sisters within the same family. Most families seek help when their child's symptoms begin to interfere with learning and adjustment to the expectations of school and age-appropriate activities.
What are the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder?
The following are the most common symptoms of ADHD. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. The 3 categories of symptoms of ADHD include the following:
Inattention:
Short attention span for age (difficulty sustaining attention)
Difficulty listening to others
Difficulty attending to details
Easily distracted
Forgetfulness
Poor organizational skills for age
Poor study skills for age
Impulsivity:
Often interrupts others
Has difficulty waiting for his or her turn in school and/or social games
Tends to blurt out answers instead of waiting to be called upon
Takes frequent risks, and often without thinking before acting
Hyperactivity:
Seems to be in constant motion; runs or climbs, at times with no apparent goal except motion
Has difficulty remaining in his/her seat even when it is expected
Fidgets with hands or squirms when in his or her seat; fidgeting excessively
Talks excessively
Has difficulty engaging in quiet activities
Loses or forgets things repeatedly and often
Inability to stay on task; shifts from one task to another without bringing any to completion
The symptoms of ADHD may resemble other medical conditions or behavior problems. Keep in mind that many of these symptoms may occur in children and teens who do not have ADHD. A key element in diagnosis is that the symptoms must significantly impair adaptive functioning in both home and school environments. Always consult your child's doctor for a diagnosis.
How is attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder diagnosed?
ADHD is the most commonly diagnosed behavior disorder of childhood. A pediatrician, child psychiatrist, or a qualified mental health professional usually identifies ADHD in children. A detailed history of the child's behavior from parents and teachers, observations of the child's behavior, and psychoeducational testing contribute to making the diagnosis of ADHD. Because ADHD is a group of symptoms, diagnosis depends on evaluating results from several different sources, including physical, neurological, and psychological testing. Certain tests may be used to rule out other conditions, and some may be used to test intelligence and certain skill sets. Consult your child's doctor for more information.
Treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
Specific treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder will be determined by your child's doctor based on:
Your child's age, overall health, and medical history
Extent of your child's symptoms
Your child's tolerance for specific medications or therapies
Expectations for the course of the condition
Your opinion or preference
Major components of treatment for children with ADHD include parental support and education in behavioral training, appropriate school placement, and medication. Treatment with a psychostimulant is highly effective in most children with ADHD.
Treatment may include:
Psychostimulant medications. These medications are used for their ability to balance chemicals in the brain that prohibit the child from maintaining attention and controlling impulses. They help ""stimulate"" or help the brain to focus and may be used to reduce the major characteristics of ADHD.
Medications that are commonly used to treat ADHD include the following:
Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Metadate, Concerta, Methylin)
Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Dextrostat)
A mixture of amphetamine salts (Adderall)
Atomoxetine (Strattera). A nonstimulant SNRI (selective serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) medication with benefits for related mood symptoms. 
Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)
Psychostimulants have been used to treat childhood behavior disorders since the 1930s and have been widely studied. Traditional immediate release stimulants take effect in the body quickly, work for 1 to 4 hours, and then are eliminated from the body. Many long-acting stimulant medications are also available, lasting 8 to 9 hours, and requiring 1 daily dosing. Doses of stimulant medications need to be timed to match the child's school schedule to help the child pay attention for a longer period of time and improve classroom performance. The common side effects of stimulants may include, but are not limited to, the following:
Insomnia
Decreased appetite
Stomach aches
Headaches
Jitteriness
Rebound activation (when the effect of the stimulant wears off, hyperactive and impulsive behaviors may increase for a short period of time)
Most side effects of stimulant use are mild, decrease with regular use, and respond to dose changes. Always discuss potential side effects with your child's doctor.

Antidepressant medications may also be administered for children and adolescents with ADHD to help improve attention while decreasing aggression, anxiety, and/or depression.
Psychosocial treatments. Parenting children with ADHD may be difficult and can present challenges that create stress within the family. Classes in behavior management skills for parents can help reduce stress for all family members. Training in behavior management skills for parents usually occurs in a group setting which encourages parent-to-parent support. Behavior management skills may include the following:
Point systems
Contingent attention (responding to the child with positive attention when desired behaviors occur; withholding attention when undesired behaviors occur)
Teachers may also be taught behavior management skills to use in the classroom setting. Training for teachers usually includes use of daily behavior reports that communicate in-school behaviors to parents. Behavior management techniques tend to improve targeted behaviors (such as completing school work or keeping the child's hands to himself or herself), but are not usually helpful in reducing overall inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity.
Prevention of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
Preventive measures to reduce the incidence of ADHD in children are not known at this time. However, early detection and intervention can reduce the severity of symptoms, decrease the interference of behavioral symptoms on school functioning, enhance the child's normal growth and development, and improve the quality of life experienced by children or adolescents with ADHD."
Alagille syndrome,"What is alagille syndrome?
Alagille syndrome is an inherited condition in which bile builds up in the liver because there are too few bile ducts to drain the bile. This results in liver damage.
Your liver makes bile to help remove waste from your body. It also helps digest fats and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. The body can use these vitamins only if they are combined with fat from the foods you eat. Bile ducts are the channels that move bile out of your liver. If you do not have enough of these ducts, bile builds up in your liver. It damages your liver tissues, and ultimately can cause your liver to fail. As treatment options increase, people with this condition live longer, more comfortable lives, especially if the condition is discovered early. About 75% of people diagnosed with the syndrome in childhood live to at least age 20.
What causes alagille syndrome?
Alagille syndrome is related to the JAG1 gene mutation. It may be passed from parent to child. If you have one parent with Alagille syndrome, you have a 50% chance of developing the condition. It appears in one out of 70,000 babies and occurs in both sexes. However, about half the time, the mutation is new and not from a parent.
What are the symptoms of alagille syndrome?
Symptoms of Alagille syndrome usually appear in the first two years of life. The following are the most common symptoms of Alagille syndrome. However, each person may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Yellow skin or eyes. Bile is colored with a pigment called bilirubin. Some of the changes you might see when your liver isn’t able to get rid of bile well enough are related to this pigment. If bile isn’t leaving your body properly, you may have yellowish skin and yellowing in the whites of your eyes, called jaundice. Your stool may appear pale, gray, or white because of a lack of bile. Your urine also can appear a darker color. A newborn may have jaundice for a few days or weeks until his or her liver works more effectively.
Itchy skin. Increased bilirubin in your body can cause an itching sensation, called pruritus.
Delayed growth. Alagille syndrome can make it hard for the body to use nutrients, such as fat-soluble vitamins. This can affect growth and normal development.
Hard skin bumps. Yellow growths called xanthomas are small amounts of fat that collect under the skin because of high cholesterol levels in your body.
Heart murmur. This is caused by narrower-than-normal blood vessels that take blood from the heart to the lungs.
Changes in blood vessels. The blood vessels in the head and neck may be formed abnormally. Other blood vessels can also become smaller or unusually shaped. These changes in blood vessels can lead to serious health problems such as stroke.
Facial characteristics. Children with this condition may have deep-set eyes; a prominent, wide forehead; a straight nose; and a pointed, small chin. These characteristics may not be visible until after infancy.
Spinal growth changes. Bones in the spine may appear different on X-rays but usually don’t cause any difficulties for patients and aren’t visible to the naked eye.
Kidney disease. Kidneys may be smaller, contain cysts, or simply work less efficiently.
Enlarged spleen. Because the liver isn’t able to rid itself of excess fluids effectively, blood may back up into the spleen. This can cause the spleen to swell. The spleen’s job is to help clean the blood and prevent infection. An enlarged spleen is more likely to be injured, especially in sports play.
White ring in the eye. A ring on the cornea, called a posterior embryotoxon, is a classic sign of the syndrome. The ring is visible during an eye exam.
The symptoms of Alagille syndrome may look like other medical conditions or problems. Always consult your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is alagille syndrome diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will perform an exam and obtain a medical history. Other tests may be done to evaluate whether you have Alagille syndrome may include:
Liver biopsy
Heart and blood vessel tests
Eye exams
Spine X-ray
Abdominal ultrasound
Kidney function tests
Genetic testing
A diagnosis of Alagille syndrome is confirmed by a liver biopsy that shows fewer bile ducts than normal and at least 3 of these symptoms:
Face shapes characteristic of Alagille syndrome
Unusual bone/spine structures such as a butterfly vertebrae
Unusual heart/blood vessel structures or a heart murmur
Liver problems
A characteristic white ring on the cornea
How is alagille syndrome treated?
Your healthcare provider will figure out the best treatment for you based on:
Your age
Your overall health and past health
How sick you are
How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Specific treatments for Alagille syndrome may include:
Medicine to increase bile flow out of the liver
Medicine to relieve itching sensations
Skin care, such as moisturizers, to reduce itching
Vitamin supplements
High-calorie food supplements
Surgery to redirect bile so that less bilirubin ends up in your blood
Liver transplant in the case of liver failure
What are the complications of alagille syndrome?
Bleeding into the brain
Bone fractures
Death
Delayed mental or physical growth or failure to thrive
Diarrhea
Heart disease
Kidney failure
Liver failure, which happens in about 15% of those affected
Malnutrition
Pancreas disease
Problems with the eyes
Can alagille syndrome be prevented?
Genetic testing and a discussion of the inherited risks within your family may help you make informed decisions about preventing this disease in future generations.
Living with alagille syndrome
Alagille syndrome affects many organs and aspects of your life. Make sure you:
Work closely with your medical team to increase bile flow and treat symptoms, such as itching, related to bile backup.
Ask questions if you do not understand how to use medicines.
Follow instructions for diet or lifestyle changes to improve health and comfort.
When to call the doctor about alagille syndrome
Alagille syndrome has wide-ranging effects that may be different as the years go by and your treatment may need to be changed. Talk with your medical team to find out which signs and symptoms require immediate medical attention. In general, be aware of the symptoms listed above. Contact your healthcare provider if symptoms get worse despite treatment or if new symptoms appear.
Key points
Alagille syndrome is a genetic disorder in which you have fewer bile ducts than normal in your liver.
Alagille syndrome can be passed from parent to child or happen naturally.
Alagille syndrome not only affects the liver, it can also cause skin, heart, facial, kidney, and eye abnormalities.
Treatment for Alagille syndrome can prevent or minimize complications and improve quality of life.
Treatment needs to change over time, so it is important to work with your healthcare provider.
Genetic counseling can help you understand your family’s risk for Alagille syndrome."
Allergic conjunctivitis,"What is conjunctivitis in children?
Conjunctivitis or pink eye is an irritation of the conjunctiva of the eye. The conjunctiva is the membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids. It also covers the actual eye.
What causes conjunctivitis in children?
There are many different causes of this problem. The following are the most common causes:
Bacteria
Viruses
Chemicals used in medicines for the eye
Allergies
Conjunctivitis is usually divided into at least two categories: newborn conjunctivitis and childhood conjunctivitis. Each has different causes and treatments.
Newborn
The following are the most common causes for the conjunctivitis in newborns:
Infection from the gonorrhea virus passed on during childbirth
Infection from Chlamydia passed on during childbirth
Reaction to chemicals in eye drops
Other bacterial causes
Children
This is a very common problem in children. Also, large outbreaks of conjunctivitis are often seen in day cares and schools. These are the most common causes:
Bacteria
Viruses
Allergies
Herpes infection
What are the symptoms of conjunctivitis in children?
The following are the most common symptoms of the condition. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Gritty feeling in one or both eyes
Itchy, irritated eyes
Clear, thin drainage and increased tearing
Sneezing and runny nose
Stringy discharge from the eyes
Thick, green drainage from the eyes
Ear infection
Lesion with a crusty appearance
Eyes that are matted together in the morning
Swelling of the eyelids
Pink or red discoloration of the whites of one or both eyes
Discomfort when the child looks at a light
Burning in the eyes
The symptoms of conjunctivitis sometimes look like other medical problems. Always see your child’s health care provider for a diagnosis.
How is conjunctivitis in children diagnosed?
Conjunctivitis is usually diagnosed based on a complete medical history and physical examination of your child’s eye. Cultures of the eye drainage are usually not required. However, cultures may be done to help confirm the cause of the infection.
How is conjunctivitis in children treated?
Your child’s health care provider will figure out the best treatment for your child based on:
How old your child is
His or her overall health and medical history
How sick he or she is
How well you can handle specific medications, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
The symptoms of conjunctivitis sometimes look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see your child’s health care provider for a diagnosis.

Infection can spread from one eye to the other. It can also spread to other people by touching the affected eye or drainage from the eye. Proper hand washing is very important. Also avoid touching your eyes with your hands, change pillowcases often, and do not reuse tissues or hand towels on your face. Drainage from the eye is contagious for 24 to 48 hours after starting treatment.
The condition will be treated based on its cause. Treatment can include:
Allergy drops for the eye
Antibiotic drops for the eye
Pills
What are the complications of conjunctivitis in children?
The condition usually does not have long-term complications. However, herpes can cause a serious type of infections. It may result in scarring of the eye and loss of vision if it is not treated properly right away.
When should I call my child’s healthcare provider?
If your child’s symptoms get worse or your child has new symptoms, call your child’s healthcare provider.

Allergic pulmonary aspergillosis,"What is allergic pulmonary aspergillosis?
Allergic pulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to a fungus called aspergillus, which causes inflammation of the airways and air sacs of the lungs. Although most people are frequently exposed to aspergillus, which can grow on dead leaves and other decaying vegetation, infections caused by it, such as a pneumonia or fungus ball (aspergilloma), are rare. Some people, however, have an allergic reaction to this fungus, which is called allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). The disease may mimic asthma or pneumonia; in fact, most patients with ABPA have asthma as well.
Symptoms
Worsening symptoms of asthma
Wheezing
Cough may produce brownish plugs or bloody sputum
Fever
Diagnosis
Exams and tests include:
Serum IgE antibodies
Aspergillus antigen skin test
Serum aspergillus antibodies
Chest X-ray
CT scan of the chest
Sputum stain and culture for fungus
Bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy
Lung biopsy (rare)
Treatment
Allergic aspergillosis is treated with prednisone. The anti-fungal antibiotic itraconazole can also be helpful. People with asthma should also continue their usual treatments.
Prognosis
The response to therapy is usually good, with improvement over time. Relapses requiring repeat treatment are common.
Prevention
People with predisposing factors like asthma or cystic fibrosis should try to avoid environments where this fungus is found if possible.
Information about this condition, its diagnosis and treatment is provided by physicians, nurses and other clinical staff in the Division of Pulmonary Medicine at Johns Hopkins Children's Center."
Allergic rhinitis,"What is rhinitis?
Rhinitis is when a reaction occurs that causes nasal congestion, runny nose, sneezing, and itching. Most types of rhinitis are caused by an inflammation and are associated with symptoms in the eyes, ears, or throat.
There are several types of rhinitis. The most common are acute rhinitis, which is usually caused by a viral illness, allergic or seasonal rhinitis, and nonallergic or year-round rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is caused when allergens in the air trigger the release of histamine in the body. Histamine causes itching, swelling, and fluid to build up in the fragile linings of the nasal passages, sinuses, and eyelids.
What causes rhinitis?
The most common causes of rhinitis are:
Pollen given off by trees, grass, and weeds
Dust mites
Mold
Cockroach waste
Animal dander
Fumes and odors
Temperature
Hormonal changes
Certain medicines and overuse of topical nose sprays
Changes in the environment
Smoke
Certain foods or spices
Who is at risk for rhinitis?
People with asthma are at a higher risk for rhinitis. Allergic rhinitis is a common problem that may be linked to asthma. However, this link is not fully understood. Experts think that since rhinitis makes it hard to breathe through the nose, it is harder for the nose to work normally. Breathing through the mouth does not warm, filter, or humidify the air before it enters the lungs. This can make asthma symptoms worse.
Controlling allergic rhinitis may help control asthma in some people.
What are the symptoms of rhinitis?
Symptoms of rhinitis include:
Sneezing
Stuffy nose
Runny nose
Itchy nose, throat, eyes, and ears
Nosebleeds
Clear drainage from the nose
Ear infections that keep coming back
Snoring
Breathing through the mouth
Tiredness
How is rhinitis diagnosed?
Most often, the diagnosis is made by your healthcare provider based on an in-depth history and physical exam. In addition to the above signs, the healthcare provider may find:
Dark circles under the eyes
Creases under the eyes
Swollen tissues inside the nose
Mouth breathing
How is rhinitis treated?
Avoidance of the allergens that are causing the problem is the best treatment. The symptoms of rhinitis sometimes look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
Treatments for rhinitis may include:
Antihistamines
Nose sprays
Decongestants
Medicines for asthma symptoms
Allergy shots
Surgery for some health problems
Can rhinitis be prevented?
Preventive measures for avoiding allergic rhinitis include:
Avoiding areas where there is heavy dust, mites, or molds
Avoiding pets
Avoiding what you know you are allergic to
Controls in your environment, such as air conditioning during pollen season
Key points about rhinitis
Rhinitis is a reaction that happens in the eyes, nose, and throat when allergens in the air trigger histamine to be released in the body.
Some of the most common causes of rhinitis are pollen, dust mites, mold, cockroach waste, animal dander, fumes and odors, hormonal changes, and smoke.
Symptoms of rhinitis include: sneezing, stuffy, runny, and itchy nose, and itchy throat, eyes, and ears, nosebleeds, clear drainage from the nose, ear infections that keep coming back, snoring, breathing through the mouth, and tiredness.
Treatment for rhinitis includes: medicines, allergy shots, and surgery for some health problems
Preventive measures for rhinitis include avoiding what you are allergic to."
Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,"Acute Liver Failure
This alarming syndrome usually occurs in a previously well infant, child or adolescent and can be caused by a number of infectious or metabolic causes and reactions to medication.
Jaundice occurs rapidly, often in concert with gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and fever.
We are committed to serving children with this disorder as soon as we are notified and work with our emergency transport team, intensive care specialists and if necessary, our pediatric liver surgeons to provide 24-hour care for the best outcome possible for children with this condition.
What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an inherited disease in which a protein known as A1AT is unable to be released from the liver into the blood in adequate amounts. This causes a deficiency of the A1AT protein in the circulation. A1AT is a specialized protein that blocks the action of other proteins important in inflammation (swelling) and breakdown of tissues in the body. When the A1AT protein is deficient in the circulation, tissue inflammation and tissue damage is more severe, especially in the lungs. The defective A1AT protein that remains in the liver may cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) that can progress to cirrhosis (permanent liver scarring) and liver failure.
A1AT deficiency is quite common, with about 1 in 1,500 to 2,000 people affected. Both parents must be carriers of the genetic defect to have a child with A1AT deficiency. Although carrier parents partially produce the abnormal A1AT protein, they usually have no — or very minimal — symptoms and they may not realize they are partially affected until their child is diagnosed with the condition.
Symptoms
About 10 percent of newborns with liver disease will be diagnosed with A1AT deficiency. Newborns may develop jaundice as part of inflammation of the liver associated with A1AT deficiency. Older children and teens can present with a liver that has been inflamed for a long time, causing scarring (cirrhosis) to develop. Lung disease usually develops only in adulthood. Adults with A1AT deficiency may have difficulties with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, coughing and repeated lung infections.
Diagnosis
Testing is usually done when a child has liver inflammation of uncertain cause or when a family history suggests A1AT liver disease. The standard screening test is to measure the amount of A1AT protein in the circulation. In cases of A1AT deficiency, the serum A1AT level will be low. When a low A1AT level is found, an additional test is usually done to identify the types of abnormal A1AT proteins that are in the circulation. In rare cases, a more detailed analysis of the DNA in the gene may be necessary.
The amount of liver swelling and damage can be assessed by ultrasonography (sonogram) of the abdomen, blood tests of liver inflammation and function and a liver biopsy, where a small piece of liver tissue is obtained and then examined under the microscope to search for changes typical of A1AT deficiency.
Treatment
There is no cure for A1AT deficiency. Therapy involves controlling symptoms and attempting to prevent the development of complications. To protect their lungs, it is very important that the affected person and those around them not smoke. Vaccinations to protect against viruses, such as hepatitis A and hepatitis B, that can further damage the liver should be given. It is difficult to predict how severely a liver will be affected. Liver function tests are followed over time. Some patients may have minimal liver disease during their entire lifetime; however, a small number will eventually require liver transplant.
Cirrhosis or Chronic Liver Failure
Cirrhosis or chronic liver failure can be caused by a number of the liver and biliary diseases listed in Clinical Services or sometimes appear without known cause. Our approach to pediatric patients with this problem is to start with a thorough history and physical examination and nutritional assessment.
We also have a frank discussion with the patient and family about what is involved in the evaluation for a life-saving liver transplant.
Liver Cyst or Tumor
There are multiple benign and malignant malformations or tumors that can occur in the liver of a child.
Our approach begins with a thorough review of medical records and imaging studies. We work closely with our interventional radiologists and surgeons to establish an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible.
If the diagnosis is a malignant tumor, then we work with the pediatric oncologists and pediatric surgeons to decide the very best approach, which may include chemotherapy, radiation, embolization, surgical removal and/or liver transplantation."
Amblyopia,"What is amblyopia?
Lazy eye, also known as amblyopia, is one of the most common eye disorders in children. Lazy eye occurs when vision in one (or possibly both) of the eyes is impaired because the eye and the brain are not properly working together. This condition is sometimes confused with strabismus, also known as a misalignment of the eyes.
What is the risk of developing lazy eye?
Lazy eye is present in approximately 2%–4% of the U.S. population. The risk of developing the condition increases if a child:
Is born prematurely
Experiences a development delay
Has a family history of lazy eye
What causes lazy eye?
There are three known causes of lazy eye:
Strabismus: Known as strabismic amblyopia, a misalignment of the eyes causes the brain to ignore input from the askew eye in order to avoid the confusion of double vision in a young developing brain. This eye then experiences a drop off or total loss in visual acuity as the brain favors the eye that is straight.
Refractive errors: Known as refractive amblyopia, poor visual development is caused by a difference in the amount of refractive error between the eyes. Although the child may have correct eye alignment, he or she may experience substantial nearsightedness, farsightedness and/or astigmatism in one eye, while experiencing none of these symptoms in the other.
When this happens, the brain becomes dependent on the better eye, while largely ignoring the issues of the eye with more refractive error. This leads to a lack of use and amblyopia in that eye.
Obstruction of vision: Known as deprivation amblyopia, the obstruction of light from a child’s eye prevents the development of proper visual acuity. This can be caused by:
Cataract (a cloudy lens)
Droopy eyelid (ptosis)
Corneal scar
How is lazy eye diagnosed?
Lazy eye is diagnosed through a routine eye exam. Your child’s first eye exam should take place between the ages of 6 and 12 months old. Pediatricians routinely screen for general eye problems.
Lazy Eye Signs and Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of lazy eye include:
Misalignment of the eyes, or strabismus
Poor depth perception and peripheral vision
Repeated eye closure or squinting
Eyes that don’t move in the same direction when the child is trying to focus.
A persistent head turn or head tilt
Persistent shaking of the eyes
Lazy Eye Treatment
Lazy eye is generally treated by forcing the nonworking eye to work more actively. Lazy eye should be treated in early childhood to prevent it from becoming permanent, but studies have shown that older children may also benefit from treatment.
Eye patch
The standard treatment method for lazy eye, an eye patch is placed on the stronger eye in order to restore the brain’s attention to the visual input from the weaker eye. This allows proper visual development to occur in the weaker eye.
Corrective lenses and glasses
When dealing with lazy eye from refractive errors, vision restoration can be achieved with vision correcting glasses or contact lenses. 
Atropine eye drops
Similar to the patch method, this treatment is administered in the form of eye drops into the stronger eye, which temporarily weakens its vision. This restores the connection between the brain and the weaker eye to strengthen its visual input.
This treatment involves constant dilation of the strong eye, which can bring about light sensitivity and difficulty in clearly seeing near objects during treatment. This form of treatment is most useful for farsighted prescriptions.
Surgery
Treatment of strabismic amblyopia often involves strabismus surgery to align the eyes. This surgery is typically followed by additional treatment methods such as the use of an eye patch on the stronger eye, atropine eye drops to the stronger eye, and/or eye therapy exercises to strengthen the weaker eye. In some cases, more than one strabismus surgery may be needed.
Treatment of deprivation amblyopia will usually require an operating room procedure, such as cataract surgery, droopy eyelid surgery or the surgical removal of corneal scars."
Anaphylaxis,"What is anaphylaxis?
Anaphylaxis, also called allergic or anaphylactic shock, is a sudden, severe and life-threatening allergic reaction that involves the whole body. The reaction is marked by constriction of the airways, leading to difficulty breathing. Swelling of the throat may block the airway in severe cases. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as severe abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhea, may also occur. Histamines, the substances released by the body during an allergic reaction, cause the blood vessels to expand, which in turn causes a dangerous drop in blood pressure. Fluid can leak into the lungs, causing swelling (pulmonary edema). Anaphylaxis can also cause heart rhythm disturbances. Any allergen can cause this reaction, but the most common ones are insect bites, food and drugs. 
Symptoms
Symptoms develop suddenly and escalate in seconds:
Difficulty breathing
Confusion
Rapid heart beat
Swelling of the lips, tongue, throat
Wheezing
Slurred speech
Confusion
Bluish skin (cyanosis)
Light-headedness, dizziness, fainting
Hives and generalized itching
Anxiety
Heart palpitations
Nausea, vomiting
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain or cramping
Cough
Diagnosis  
As anaphylaxis is a dramatic reaction, diagnosis is relatively easy. The child will need allergy testing to determine what caused the reaction.
Treatment   
Anaphylaxis is an emergency. Assessment of the airway, breathing and circulation should be done immediately. CPR may be needed. Children with known allergies and/or past episodes of anaphylaxis should carry an EpiPen® (epinephrine injection) that must be administered immediately. Emergency intubation, which opens the airway by placing a tube through the nose or mouth, may be needed. Another option is placing the tube into the trachea by directly cutting into the trachea. Children who have a history of allergy to insect bites/stings should be instructed to carry (and use) an emergency kit consisting of an EpiPen and should wear a MedicAlert bracelet/necklace showing their allergy. 
When to Call for Help 
If your child develops the above symptoms, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room."
Ankylosing spondylitis,"What is ankylosing spondylitis?
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a type of arthritis that causes inflammation in certain parts of the spine. Ankylosing means stiff or rigid. Spondyl means spine. Itis refers to inflammation. The disease causes inflammation of the spine and large joints, resulting in stiffness and pain. The disease may damage the joint between the spine and the hipbone. This is called the sacroiliac joint. It may also cause bony bridges to form between vertebrae in the spine, fusing those bones. Bones in the chest may also fuse.
What causes ankylosing spondylitis?
The exact cause of AS is unknown. But researchers think that genetics play a role. A gene called HLA-B27 is found in most white Americans who have AS. But this gene is found in only 50% of African Americans who have AS. There are also some people with the HLA-B27 gene that don't develop AS. Less than 5% of people with the HLA-B27 gene have AS.
Who is at risk for ankylosing spondylitis?
AS is more common among people ages 17 to 35. It can happen in children and older adults, as well. The disease affects more young men than women. It tends to run in families.
What are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis?
Symptoms of AS tend to come and go over time. Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each person. The symptoms may include:
Back pain, usually most severe at night during rest
Early morning stiffness
Stooped posture in response to back pain (bending forward tends to relieve the pain)
Straight and stiff spine
Inability to take a deep breath, if the joints between the ribs and spine are affected
Appetite loss
Weight loss
Fatigue
Fever
Anemia
Joint pain
Mild eye inflammation
Organ damage, such as to the heart, lungs, and eyes
Skin rashes
Digestive illness (such as Crohn's or ulcerative colitis)
Many of these symptoms may be caused by other health problems. Make sure to see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is ankylosing spondylitis diagnosed?
Diagnosis starts with a health history and physical exam. You may also need tests, such as:
X-ray. This test uses a small amount of radiation to create images of internal tissues, bones, and organs onto film.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR or sed rate). This test looks at how quickly red blood cells fall to the bottom of a test tube. When swelling and inflammation are present, the blood's proteins clump together and become heavier than normal. They fall and settle faster at the bottom of the test tube. The faster the blood cells fall, the more severe the inflammation. Up to 7 in 10 people with AS have a high ESR.
Genetic testing. Genetic testing is done to find if a person carries a copy of an altered gene for a disease. The gene HLA-B27 is found in more than 19 in 20 people with AS.
How is ankylosing spondylitis treated?
Treatment will depend on your symptoms, your age, and your general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. The goal of treatment is to ease pain and stiffness, prevent deformities, and maintain as normal a lifestyle as possible. Treatment may include:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to ease pain and inflammation
Tumor-necrosis-factor blockers (biologic medicines), to ease inflammation and swelling
Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) inhibitors, to ease inflammation and swelling
Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic medicines (DMARDs), such as sulfasalazine, to ease inflammation and control AS
Short-term use of corticosteroids, to ease inflammation
Short-term use of muscle relaxants and pain relievers, to ease severe pain and muscle spasms
Surgery to replace a joint, place rods in the spine, or remove parts of the thickened and hardened bone
Maintaining of proper posture
Regular exercise, including exercises that strengthen back muscles
Talk with your healthcare provider about the risks, benefits, and possible side effects of all medicines.
What are the possible complications of ankylosing spondylitis?
Over time, a forward curve of the spine can develop in people with AS. People with AS are at great risk of thinning of the bones (osteoporosis). This can result in spinal fractures. In more advanced cases, inflammation leads to new bone formation in the spine. This causes parts of the spine to fuse together, resulting in immobility. AS can also lead to psoriasis, and inflammation of the eye, aortic valve, and intestinal tract.
Living with ankylosing spondylitis
There is no cure for AS, so it is important to work on a treatment plan with your healthcare provider. Work on lifestyle changes that can improve your quality of life. Stay active and keep up with exercise to reduce pain. A physical therapist can help you design an exercise plan and help you keep a good posture.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
If your symptoms get worse or you have new symptoms, let your healthcare provider know right away.
Key points about ankylosing spondylitis
Ankylosing spondylitis is a type of arthritis that causes inflammation in certain parts of the spine.
A gene may be part of the cause of AS. But an exact cause is unknown.
Symptoms of AS include back pain, early morning stiffness, and a stooped posture.
AS can cause other symptoms such as appetite loss, weight loss, fatigue, fever, anemia, eye inflammation, and digestive illness.
The goal of treatment for AS is to ease pain and stiffness, prevent deformities, and maintain as normal a lifestyle as possible.
Staying active is important in the management of AS.

Aplastic anemia,"What is aplastic anemia?
Aplastic anemia occurs when your bone marrow doesn’t make enough red and white blood cells, and platelets. Having fewer red blood cells causes hemoglobin to drop.
Hemoglobin is the part of blood that carries oxygen through your body. Having fewer white blood cells makes you more likely to get an infection. And having fewer platelets makes the blood too thin. This means your blood can’t clot the way it should.
What causes aplastic anemia?
Aplastic anemia has many causes. Sometimes it occurs for no known reason. Other causes are linked to a previous illness or disorder. Acquired causes may include:
History of certain infectious diseases (such as hepatitis, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, CMV, or paravirus B19)
History of taking certain medicines, such as antibiotics and anticonvulsants
Exposure to certain toxins, such as heavy metals
Exposure to radiation
History of an autoimmune disease, such as lupus
Inherited condition"
Apnea of prematurity,"What is apnea of prematurity?
Apnea of prematurity occurs when newborns, especially those born prematurely, stop breathing for short periods of time. Apnea can be caused by immaturity of the brain and weakness of the muscles that keep the airway open. At times, additional stresses in a premature baby — including infection, heart or lung problems, low blood count, low oxygen levels, temperature problems, feeding problems and overstimulation — may worsen apnea.
Symptoms
Very shallow breathing. The baby may also experience a drop in the heart rate, known as bradycardia. The baby may or may not have associated poor color and an appearance of not looking well.
Diagnosis
Because most preterm babies have some degree of apnea, they are usually kept on monitors that measure heart rate and breathing rate. Alarms are set to notify the staff when lower heart rate or breathing rate limits are met.
Treatment
Treatment of apnea depends on the most likely causes, the frequency of apnea spells and the severity of spells. Babies who appear to be otherwise healthy with few spells per day are simply watched and can be gently stimulated during their occasional episodes. Babies who appear well but with multiple spells may be placed on a caffeine preparation to help stimulate their breathing. Proper positioning, slower feeding time, oxygen and in some cases ventilator support may be needed to assist in breathing.
Prognosis
Because apnea is common in premature newborns and because most of these babies have normal outcomes, it is felt that mild apnea does not have long-term effects. However, most doctors feel that prevention of multiple or severe episodes is better for the baby in the long run."
Appendicitis,"What is appendicitis?
The appendix is a thin tube that is joined to the large intestine. It sits in the lower right part of your belly (abdomen). When you are a young child, your appendix is a working part of your immune system, which helps your body to fight disease. When you are older, your appendix stops doing this and other parts of your body keep helping to fight infection.
The appendix can get infected. If not treated it can burst (rupture). This can happen as soon as 48 to 72 hours after you have symptoms. Because of this, appendicitis is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms, see a doctor right away to avoid more infection, which can be life-threatening."
Arteriovenous malformations,"Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) happen when a group of blood vessels in your body forms incorrectly. In these malformations, arteries and veins are unusually tangled and form direct connections, bypassing normal tissues. This usually happens during development before birth or shortly after.
Most people with AVMs have no initial symptoms or problems. Instead, the problem is discovered when health care providers treat another unrelated health concern. Sometimes the rupture of one of the blood vessels in an AVM will bring the issue to medical attention. Sometimes AVMs are only found after death, during an autopsy.
© Eleanor Bailey
Facts About AVMs
Most people with AVMs will never have any problems. If symptoms have not appeared by the time a person is 50, they may never appear. Women sometimes have symptoms as a result of the burden that pregnancy places on the blood vessels. Nearly 12 percent of people with AVMs do have some symptoms, however.
No one knows why AVMs form. Some experts believe that the risk of developing AVMs could be genetic. AVMs can form anywhere in the body. Those that form in the brain or close to the spinal cord, called neurological AVMs, are most likely to have long-term effects.
The biggest concern related to AVMs is that they will cause uncontrolled bleeding, or hemorrhage. Fewer than 4 percent of AVMs hemorrhage, but those that do can have severe, even fatal, effects. Death as a direct result of an AVM happens in about 1 percent of people with AVMs.
Sometimes AVMs can reduce the amount of oxygen getting to the brain and spinal cord (this is sometimes called a ""steal"" effect, as if the blood were being ""stolen"" from where it should be flowing). AVMs can sometimes put pressure on surrounding tissues. Steal can also occur elsewhere in the body, such as in the hands or feet, but may not be as apparent.
An AVM occurs when arteries and veins aren't formed correctly in an area of the body. Normally arteries take blood from the heart to the body. Blood with fresh oxygen and nutrients is brought through the arteries into very tiny vessels called capillaries. Through these tiny vessels, blood travels into the body's tissues. Blood then leaves the tissues through the capillaries and empties into veins, which bring blood back to the heart. Capillaries are tiny vessels that help the blood to slow down. This allows the blood to deliver oxygen and nutrients into tissues.
In an AVM, there are no capillaries, so blood does not slow down, and it does not get to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the body's tissues. Instead, blood that is flowing very fast (high flow) goes directly from an artery to a vein. Rarely, if there is a lot of flow through an AVM, it can cause the heart to work too hard to keep up, leading to heart failure.
Although present at birth, an AVM may be found soon after birth or much later in life, depending on its size and location. AVMs can become apparent after an accident or as a child grows into an adult (during puberty). As a patient's body grows, the AVM grows too.
AVMs grow and change over time. AVMs are often organized using a scale called the Schöbinger staging system. Not all AVMS go through every stage.
Stage I (quiescence): The AVM is ""quiet."" The skin on top of the AVM may be warm and pink or red.
Stage II (expansion): The AVM gets larger. A pulse can be felt or heard in the AVM.
Stage III (destruction): The AVM causes pain, bleeding or ulcers.
Stage IV (decompensation): Heart failure occurs."
Arthralgia,"What is arthralgia?
Arthralgia describes joint stiffness. Among its many causes are overuse, sprains, injury, gout, tendonitis and a number of infectious diseases, including rheumatic fever and chickenpox.
Symptoms
Symptoms can include:
Back pain
Loss of spine flexibility
Inflammation of the eyes, lungs and heart valves
Swelling and stiffness of the spine and sacroiliac joints
Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires careful clinical evaluation.
Treatment
For non-arthritis joint pain, rest and exercise can help, as can warm baths, massage and stretching exercises. On the advice of a physician, anti-inflammatory medications may help relieve pain and swelling."
Arthritis,"Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases are common conditions that cause pain, swelling, and limited movement. They affect joints and connective tissues around the body. Millions of people in the U.S. have some form of arthritis.
Arthritis means redness and swelling (inflammation) of a joint. A joint is where 2 or more bones meet. There are more than 100 different arthritis diseases. Rheumatic diseases include any condition that causes pain, stiffness, and swelling in joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments, or bones. Arthritis is usually ongoing (chronic).
Arthritis and other rheumatic diseases are more common in women than men. They are also often linked with old age. But they affect people of all ages.
The 2 most common forms of arthritis are:
Osteoarthritis. This is the most common type of arthritis. It is a chronic disease of the joints, especially the weight-bearing joints of the knee, hip, and spine. It destroys the coating on the ends of bones (cartilage) and narrows the joint space. It can also cause bone overgrowth, bone spurs, and reduced function. It occurs in most people as they age. It may also occur in young people because of an injury or overuse.
Rheumatoid arthritis. This is an inflammatory disease of the joint linings. The inflammation may affect all of the joints. It can also affect organs such as the heart or lungs.
Other forms of arthritis or related disorders include:
Gout. This condition causes uric acid crystals to build up in small joints, such as the big toe. It causes pain and inflammation.
Lupus. This is a chronic autoimmune disorder. It causes periods of inflammation and damage in joints, tendons, and organs.
Scleroderma. This autoimmune disease causes thickening and hardening of the skin and other connective tissue in the body.
Ankylosing spondylitis. This disease causes the bones of the spine to grow together. It can also cause inflammation in other parts of the body. It can affect the shoulders, hips, ribs, and the small joints of the hands and feet.
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA). This is a form of arthritis in children that causes inflammation and joint stiffness. Children often outgrow JRA. But it can affect bone development in a growing child.

Symptoms
Joint swelling, stiffness
Reduced range of motion
Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires careful clinical evaluation to determine the cause of the symptoms.
Treatment
Medicines and physical therapy can help maintain motion and ease pain and swelling."
Asthma,"Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory lung disease involving recurrent breathing problems. The characteristics of asthma are three airway problems:
Obstruction
Inflammation
Hyperresponsiveness
What are the symptoms of asthma?
Common symptoms of asthma are listed below. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently.
In some cases, the only symptom is a chronic cough, especially at night, or tightness, noisy breathing, or wheezing. Some people think they have recurrent bronchitis, since respiratory infections usually settle in the chest in a person predisposed to asthma.
Asthma may resemble other respiratory problems, such as emphysema, bronchitis, and lower respiratory infections. Many people with asthma do not know they have it. Consult your doctor for a diagnosis.
What causes asthma?
The basic cause of the lung abnormality in asthma is not yet known, although health care professionals have established that it is a special type of inflammation of the airway that leads to the following:
Contraction of airway muscles
Mucus production
Swelling in the airways
It is important to know that asthma is not caused by emotional factors—as was commonly believed years ago. Emotional anxiety and nervous stress can cause fatigue, which may affect the immune system and increase asthma symptoms or aggravate an attack. However, these reactions are considered to be more of an effect than a cause.
What happens during an asthma attack?
People with asthma have acute episodes when the air passages in their lungs get narrower, and breathing becomes more difficult. These problems are caused by an oversensitivity of the lungs and airways:
Lungs and airways overreact to certain triggers and become inflamed and clogged.
Breathing becomes harder and may hurt.
There may be coughing.
There may be a wheezing or whistling sound, which is typical of asthma. Wheezing occurs because:
Muscles that surround the airways tighten, and the inner lining of the airways swells and pushes inward.
Membranes that line the airways secrete extra mucus.
The mucus can form plugs that further block the air passages.
The rush of air through the narrowed airways produces the wheezing sounds.
What are the risk factors for an asthma attack?
Although anyone may have an asthma attack, it most commonly occurs in:
Children and adolescents between age 5 and 17
Females
People living in urban communities
Exposure to tobacco smoke
Other factors include:
Family history of asthma
Personal medical history of allergies
How is asthma diagnosed?
To diagnose asthma and distinguish it from other lung disorders, doctors rely on a combination of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests, which may include:
Spirometry. A spirometer is a device used by your doctor that assesses lung function. Spirometry is the evaluation of lung function with a spirometer. The test is performed by blowing as hard as possible into a tube connected to a small machine (a spirometer) that measures the amount of air breathed out and in as well as the speed it is breathed out. This is one of the simplest, most common pulmonary function tests and may be necessary for any/all of the following reasons:
To determine how well the lungs receive, hold, and utilize air
To monitor a lung disease
To monitor the effectiveness of treatment
To determine the severity of a lung disease
To determine whether the lung disease is restrictive (decreased airflow) or obstructive (disruption of airflow)
Peak flow monitoring (PFM). A device is used to measure the fastest speed in which a person can blow air out of the lungs. To use a peak flow meter, a person takes a deep breath in and then blows as hard and fast as possible into a mouthpiece. During an asthma or other respiratory flare-up, the large airways in the lungs slowly begin to narrow. This will slow the speed of air leaving the lungs and can be measured by a PFM. This measurement is very important in evaluating how well or how poorly the disease is being controlled.
Chest X-rays. This diagnostic test uses invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs onto film.
Blood tests. Blood tests are used to analyze the amount of carbon dioxide and oxygen in the blood.

Specific treatment for asthma will be determined by your doctor based on:
Your age, overall health, and medical history
Your symptoms
Extent of the disease
Your tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the disease
Your opinion or preference
As of yet, there is no cure for asthma. However, it can often be controlled with prescription medications that may help to prevent or relieve symptoms, and by learning ways to manage episodes.
How is asthma managed?
People with asthma can learn to identify and avoid the things that trigger an episode. They can also educate themselves about medications and other asthma management strategies:
Asthma is a chronic disease. It has to be cared for all the time—not just when symptoms are present:
The four parts of continually managing asthma are:
Identify and minimize contact with asthma triggers.
Understand and take medications as prescribed.
Monitor asthma to recognize signs when it is getting worse.
Know what to do when asthma gets worse.
Working with a health care professional is the best way to take care of asthma.
The more information a person with asthma has, the better asthma can be controlled.
Four components of asthma treatment
The use of objective measures of lung function—spirometry, peak flow expiratory flow rate—to access the severity of asthma, and to monitor the course of treatment.
The use of medication therapy designed to reverse and prevent the airway inflammation component of asthma, as well as to treat the narrowing airways.
The use of environmental control measures to avoid or eliminate factors that induce or trigger asthma flare-ups, including the consideration of immunotherapy.
Patient education that includes a partnership among the patient, family members, and the doctor.

Astigmatism,"What is astigmatism?
Astigmatism is a type of refractive error that usually presents at birth. An abnormal shape of the cornea or lens causes two focal points in two locations, making objects up close and at a distance appear blurry. Astigmatism may occur at the same time as nearsightedness or farsightedness."
Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T),"What is ataxia telangiectasia?
Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare, inherited disease that affects several organs and systems, including the nervous and the immune systems. Most notably, it causes progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls movement and speech. Symptoms develop in early childhood. Some of the complications of A-T include cancer (typically leukemia or lymphoma), recurrent infections and chronic lung disease.
Symptoms
Uncoordinated movements (ataxia)
Poor balance
Slurred speech
Feeding and swallowing problems
Spider veins (telangiectasia) on the whites of the eyes
Stunted physical growth and sexual development
Immunodeficiency
Recurrent respiratory infections
Sensitivity to X-ray
Diagnosis
Physical exam
Laboratory tests, such as measuring levels of alpha-fetoprotein
Genetic tests (ATM gene)
Treatment
There is no cure for A-T. Treatment involves managing the symptoms. This may include:
Physical, occupational and/or speech therapies
Supplemental nutritional support
Treatment of immunodeficiency
Timely treatment of infections
When to Call for Help
If your child develops the above symptoms, call your pediatrician."
Atelectasis bronchiectasis,"What is atelectasis?
Atelectasis, the collapse of part or all of a lung, is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the lung. Risk factors for atelectasis include anesthesia, prolonged bed rest with few changes in position, shallow breathing and underlying lung disease. Mucus that plugs the airway, foreign objects in the airway (common in children) and tumors that obstruct the airway may lead to atelectasis. Large-scale atelectasis may be life threatening, especially in someone who has another lung disease or illness. In a baby or small child, lung collapse due to a mucus obstruction or other causes can be life threatening. 
Symptoms
Breathing difficulty
Chest pain
Cough
Diagnosis
Exams and tests include chest X-ray and bronchoscopy.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to remove lung secretions and re-expand the affected lung tissue. Treatments include: 
Aerosolized respiratory treatments to open the airway
Positioning the body on the unaffected side to allow the lung to re-expand
Removing obstructions by bronchoscopy
Breathing exercises (incentive spirometry)
Clap, or percussion, on the chest to loosen mucus
Tilting the body (postural drainage) so that the head is lower than the chest to drain mucus
Treating a tumor or underlying condition, if present.
Prognosis
The collapsed lung usually reinflates gradually once the obstruction has been removed. However, some residual scarring or damage may occur. 
Atelectasis is treated by the Division of Pulmonary Medicine."
B12 deficiency,"What is vitamin B12 deficiency anemia?
Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is a condition in which your body does not have enough healthy red blood cells, due to a lack (deficiency) of vitamin B12. This vitamin is needed to make red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of your body. Without enough red blood cells, your tissues and organs don’t get enough oxygen. Without enough oxygen, your body can’t work as well.
Folic acid, also called folate, is another B vitamin. Anemias caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or a lack of folate are 2 types of megaloblastic anemia. With these types of anemia, the red blood cells don’t develop normally. They are very large. And they are shaped like an oval, not round like healthy red blood cells. This causes the bone marrow to make fewer red blood cells. In some cases the red blood cells die sooner than normal.
What causes vitamin B12 deficiency anemia?
Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia is more common in people whose families come from northern Europe. It is caused by one of the following:
Lack of intrinsic factor. Intrinsic factor is a protein made in the stomach. It is needed to absorb vitamin B12. This type of B12 deficiency anemia is called pernicious anemia.
Surgery that removes or bypasses the end of the small intestine. This part of the small intestine is where vitamin B12 is absorbed.
The inability to make intrinsic factor may be caused by several things, such as:
Chronic gastritis
Surgery to remove all or part of the stomach (gastrectomy)
An autoimmune condition, where the body attacks its own tissues
Other types of megaloblastic anemia may be linked with type 1 diabetes, thyroid disease, and a family history of the disease.
The inability to make intrinsic factor may be the result of several factors, such as chronic gastritis, gastrectomy (removal of all or part of the stomach), or an autoimmune condition (the body attacks its own tissues). Other types of megaloblastic anemia may be associated with type 1 diabetes, thyroid disease, and a family history of the disease.
Who is at risk for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia?
Risk factors for vitamin B12 deficiency anemia include:
A family history of the disease
Having part or all of your stomach or intestine removed
Autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes
Crohn's disease
HIV
Some medicines
Strict vegetarian diets
Being an older adult
What are the symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency anemia?
Each person’s symptoms may vary. Symptoms may include:
Weak muscles
Numb or tingling feeling in hands and feet
Trouble walking
Nausea
Decreased appetite
Weight loss
Irritability
Lack of energy or tiring easily (fatigue)
Diarrhea
Smooth and tender tongue
Fast heart rate
The symptoms of megaloblastic anemia may look like other blood conditions or health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is vitamin B12 deficiency anemia diagnosed?
This type of anemia is usually found during a medical exam through a routine blood test. Your healthcare provider will take your medical history and give you a physical exam.
Your provider may give you additional blood tests. You may also have other evaluation procedures, such as a bone marrow biopsy.
How is vitamin B12 deficiency anemia treated?
Your healthcare provider will figure out the best treatment for you based on:
How old you are
Your overall health and medical history
How sick you are
How well you handle certain medicines, treatments, or therapies
If your condition is expected to get worse
Your opinion or preference
Vitamin B12 deficiency anemia and folate deficiency anemia often occur together and can be hard to tell apart. Treatment may include vitamin B12 shots (injections) and folic acid pills.
Foods that are rich in folic acid include the following:
Orange juice
Oranges
Romaine lettuce
Spinach
Liver
Rice
Barley
Sprouts
Wheat germ
Soy beans
Green, leafy vegetables
Beans
Peanuts
Broccoli
Asparagus
Peas
Lentils
Chickpeas (garbanzo beans)
Foods that are rich in both folic acid and vitamin B12 include the following:
Eggs
Meat
Poultry
Milk
Shellfish
Fortified cereals
Taking folic acid by mouth is more effective than eating foods rich in folic acid. Vitamin B12 is not as well absorbed by mouth as per injection.
Living with vitamin B12 deficiency anemia
Depending on the cause of your vitamin B12 deficiency, you may need to take vitamin B12 supplements for the rest of your life. These may be pills or shots. This may seem difficult. But it will let you live a normal life without symptoms.
If your deficiency is due to a restrictive diet, you may want to work with a nutritionist. He or she can help ensure that you get enough vitamin B12 and other vitamins. Tell your healthcare provider about any symptoms and follow your treatment plan.
Key points about vitamin B12 deficiency anemia
With this condition, your body does not have enough healthy red blood cells, due to a lack (deficiency) of vitamin B
It is one of several types of megaloblastic anemia.
Without enough red blood cells, your tissues and organs don’t get enough oxygen. Without enough oxygen, your body can’t work as well.
Symptoms include weak muscles, numbness, trouble walking, nausea, weight loss, irritability, fatigue, and increased heart rate.
Treatment may include vitamin B12 supplements. It is also important to eat a well-balanced diet.

Bedwetting,"What is urinary incontinence (enuresis)?
Urinary incontinence (enuresis) is the medical term for bedwetting. Incontinence is accidental or intentional urination in children who are at an age where they should be able to have control of their bladders. Girls usually obtain bladder control before boys do. Incontinence may be diagnosed in girls older than age 5 and in boys who are older than age 6 who are still having urinary control problems. There are different types of bedwetting that may occur, including the following:
Diurnal enuresis (wetting during the day)
Nocturnal enuresis (wetting during the night)
Primary enuresis (occurs when the child has never fully mastered toilet training)
Secondary enuresis (occurs when the child did have a period of dryness, but then returned to having periods of incontinence)
What are some key facts about urinary incontinence (enuresis)?
According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), nocturnal enuresis affects 5 million children older than age 6 in the U.S.
Nocturnal enuresis occurs more frequently in boys than in girls.
Of the children with bedwetting, most have wetting at night.
Primary enuresis is the most common form of urinary incontinence among children.
What causes urinary incontinence?
There are many factors that may be involved, and many theories that are given for why children wet. The following is a list of some of the possible reasons for the problem:
Poor toilet training
Delay of the ability to hold urine (this may be a factor up to about age 5)
Small bladders
Poor sleep habits or the presence of a sleep disorder
A problem with the proper functioning of hormones that help to regulate urination
Most children who wet the bed have at least one parent or a close relative who also suffered from bedwetting as a child
Medication that affects sleep
How is urinary incontinence (enuresis) diagnosed?
Urinary incontinence (enuresis) is usually diagnosed based on a complete medical history and physical examination of your child. In addition to talking with you and the child, your child's doctor may perform the following to help rule out other causes for the wetting:
Urine tests (to make sure there is not an underlying infection, or condition such as diabetes)
Blood pressure measurement
Blood tests
What is the treatment for urinary incontinence (enuresis)?
Specific treatment for enuresis will be determined by your child's doctor based on:
Your child's age, overall health, and medical history
Extent of the condition
Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the condition
Your opinion or preference
Prior to starting treatment, it is important to know that:
The child is not at fault and should not be punished. The child cannot control the wetting.
According to the AAP, enuresis usually goes away on its own in about 15 percent of affected children each year.
Treatment may include:
Positive reinforcement of the child (for example, the use of sticker charts for dry nights)
Use of night-time alarms to help tell the child when wetting is occurring
Medications, as prescribed by your child's doctor (to help control the wetting)
Bladder training to help increase the bladder size and the child's ability to know when he or she has to urinate. (This is done by having the child wait as long as possible during the day to urinate and let the bladder get full.)
Decrease fluids (AAP suggests this approach if the child believes it helps) and avoid caffeine at night
In addition, counseling of the child and family may help to determine any stress the child may be under."
Behcet’s syndrome,"What is Behcet’s Syndrome?
Also called Behcet’s disease, Behcet’s syndrome is an inflammatory disease caused by damage to and inflammation of the blood vessels. Rare in the United States, it is common in the Middle East and Asia, affecting mainly those in their 20s and 30s.
What is vasculitis?
There are many types of vasculitis, including Behcet’s disease, large vessel vasculitis syndromes (such as Takayasu vasculitis), medium vessel vasculitis syndromes and small vessel vasculitis syndromes.
Symptoms
Sores in the mouth
Other skin sores
Swelling of parts of the eye
Pain, Swelling, stiffness in joints
Diagnosis
Medical evaluation.
Treatment
There is no cure but symptoms can be controlled with medication, rest and exercise. "
Bile acid synthesis defect,"What is bile acid synthesis defect?
Bile acid synthesis defect prevents the body from making bile acid, which results in progressive liver disease. The defect is a deficiency of a particular enzyme (cholestasis with delta(4)-3-oxosteroid 5-beta-reductase) needed to make bile acid.
Symptoms
Progressive liver disease
Cholestasis
Jaundice
Liver fibrosis
Abnormal bile acid precursors in urine"
Biliary atresia,"What is Biliary Atresia?
Biliary atresia is a blockage in the tubes (ducts) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder. This congenital condition occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not develop normally. It is not known why the biliary system fails to develop normally. In babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which is deadly if not treated.
Symptoms
Newborns with this condition may appear normal at birth. However, jaundice develops by the second or third week of life. The infant may gain weight normally for the first month, but then will lose weight and become irritable, and have worsening jaundice. 
Other symptoms may include:
Dark urine
Enlarged spleen
Floating stools
Foul-smelling stools
Pale or clay-colored stools
Slow or no weight gain
Slow growth"
Birthmarks,"What are birthmarks?
Birthmarks are areas of discolored and/or raised skin that are apparent at birth or within a few weeks of birth. Birthmarks are made up of malformed pigment cells or blood vessels.
Although the cause of birthmarks is not known, most of them are benign (noncancerous) and do not require treatment. Babies with birthmarks should be examined and diagnosed by a health care provider.
What are the most common types of vascular birthmarks?
The following are the most common types of vascular birthmarks:
Macular stains or salmon patches. These are characterized by pink to red marks that may appear anywhere on the body. Angel kisses and stork bites are the most common type of vascular birthmark:
Angel's kisses. Marks located on the forehead, nose, upper lip, and eyelids that usually disappear with age.
Stork bites. Marks on the back of the neck that usually disappear with age.
Hemangioma. A common vascular birthmark. Hemangiomas become visible within the first few weeks or months of life and continue to grow rapidly for about 6 to 9 months. Then, they gradually lose this red color and also shrink. They are called strawberry patch hemangiomas. By age 5, 50% resolve and 90% resolve by age 9 without any treatment. Hemangiomas that grow into other organs or structures or become ulcerated should be evaluated by your health care provider.
Port-wine stain (also called nevus flammeus). A port-wine stain is a flat, pink, red, or purple mark that appears at birth, often on the face, arms, and legs, and continues to grow as the child grows. Port-wine stains do not go away and often need treatment if located on the eyelid or forehead. Port-wine stains involving the face may cause eye problems and be associated with other developmental disorders.
What are the most common types of pigmented birthmarks?
The following are the most common types of pigmented birthmarks:
Moles (also known as congenital nevi). These can be skin-colored, brown, or black, flat or raised and small or large. They can happen anywhere on the body. Moles can also happen in adulthood, but only moles that are present at birth are considered birthmarks. Other nevi that behave like congenital nevi can appear within the first 2 years of life. Congenital nevi can develop into cancer later in life, with larger nevi having a higher risk of becoming cancerous.
Cafe-au-lait spots. This is French for coffee with milk. These are usually oval-shaped and light brown or black. Typically these fade with age and are not a problem. However, many of them grouped together can be a sign of other health issues and should be examined by a health care provider. 
Mongolian spots. These are blue or blue-gray spots on the lower back or buttocks. They are most common in babies with darker skin, like African-American or Asian babies. They can be mistaken for bruises and they usually fade with age.  "
Bladder exstrophy,"What is Bladder Exstrophy?
An abnormality of formation of the bladder and the bony pelvis. The bladder does not form into its normal round shape but instead is flattened and exposed on the abdominal wall. The pelvic bones are also widely separated. The remainder of the lower urinary tract may also be flattened and exposed, with abnormal formation of the prostate and penis. This congenital birth defect is seen in one of 10,000 to 50,000 live births. In a family with a child with exstrophy, the likelihood of a second child being born with exstrophy is one in 100. The risk of having a child with exstrophy is one in 70, if the parents have exstrophy. Major genetic studies are currently underway at Johns Hopkins involving the exstrophy-epispadias complex.  
Diagnosis
Diagnosis can be made on careful repeated ultrasounds done before delivery, but usually the diagnosis is not made until the baby is born. The finding of the exposed bladder is typical.  
Treatment
Advances in surgery in the last 15 years have allowed reconstruction of the penis and bladder so that a more ""normal"" and functional lifestyle can be maintained by the patient and family. Current state-of-the-art treatment for exstrophy involves reconstruction of the various aspects of the deformity (i.e. closing the bladder, repair of the penis, and prevention of urine leakage. This usually involves separate operations at various times in the life of the child to obtain the best results.
Initial Closure: This is usually done soon after the baby is born. At this first operation, the pelvic bones are reformed into their normal ring shape (by a Pediatric Orthopedic surgeon), the bladder, abdominal wall, and posterior urethra are closed and the belly button is reconstructed. This procedure takes between 4-6 hours. Following surgery, the baby is placed with the lower legs in traction to prevent separating the pelvic bones. Babies are observed carefully and may be in the Intensive Care Unit to be monitored for the first day or two. The baby usually stays in the hospital for 3-4 weeks of healing. Antibiotics are given following the operation to prevent infection. The tube in the bladder is removed four weeks following surgery. The size of the bladder gradually increases over time. In very special circumstances with an excellent bladder plate and good sized penis, bladder exstrophy closure and epispadias repair can be combined. However, this is only for very experienced exstrophy surgeons.
Epispadias repair: This repair occurs around 6-12 months of age. Time of surgery and the extent of the surgery is dependent on the size of the bladder and the deformity of the penis. At this stage, the urethra on top of the flattened penis is closed and transferred to below the corporal bodies as in the normal penis.
Continence Procedure: At this time the control of urine leakage is repaired and then further enlargement of the bladder is preformed if necessary. The timing of this procedure depends totally on the capacity of the bladder and the child's emotional and developmental status. The child must ""want to be dry"" and able to participate in a voiding program.
Special Voiding Improvement Program for the Exstrophy - Epispadias Patient
Children with bladder exstrophy face a combination of medical and emotional challenges as they work with their urology team. Developing a continence management program is an ongoing process that is often stressful for children and their families. The voiding improvement program provides hands-on one-on-one assistance to the child and family before and after bladder neck repair.
The clinic is staffed by a specially trained, multidisciplinary team including a pediatric urologist, pediatric nurse practitioner, pediatric behavioral psychologist, and pediatric clinical nurse.
The Voiding Improvement Team also assists the pediatric urologist in the evaluation of readiness for bladder neck reconstruction to help the child and family prepare for the post-surgical work that will allow for favorable continence outcome.
After bladder neck reconstruction surgery we work with children and families using both behavior modification and muscle retraining procedures to teach the child, family, and the child's bladder musculature to function at their maximum potential for long-term continence.
After bladder neck surgery, frequent daily phone consultations occur until the child is voiding well and tube free.
Visit usually last one hour and may include the following treatment components:
bladder ultrasound
urine culture
medication management
biofeedback for bladder muscle retraining
establishment of a voiding urine
assessment of barrier to adherence
nutrition education
behavior therapy
relapse prevention recommendations
Progress is evaluated at each visit and communicated to the pediatric urologist.
Follow-up
Experience at the Johns Hopkins Hospital indicate that 72-75% of patients are free of urine leakage following reconstruction by the above-mentioned stages. The deformity of the penis was corrected to the satisfaction of the patient and the family in most instances. This, however, requires dedicated and intensive treatment and long-term follow up into adolescence and adulthood by the exstrophy team.

Bladder stones,"What are kidney stones?
Kidney stones are also known as renal calculi or nephrolithiasis. They typically occur in adults, but can affect children as well and can occur even in babies. Kidney stones form when high amounts of certain substances accumulate in the kidneys, forming crystals or a stone. Certain stones are caused by other diseases but many are related to diet and nutrition. Some doctors note anecdotal evidence that more children are getting this condition, possibly due to too much salt in their diets. 
Types of Kidney Stones
Calcium stones are the most common type, usually caused by high intake of certain substances, such as salt.
Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria, an inherited disorder, marked by increased formation of stones in the bladder, kidney and ureter.
Struvite stones most often occur in women who have urinary tract infections.
Urica acid stones can occur with gout or after chemotherapy.
Symptoms
Intense pain in the lower back and/or in the sides
Frequent, painful urination
Nausea, vomiting
Blood in the urine and/or cloudy urine
Urinary tract infections secondary to kidney stones accompanied by fever
Diagnosis
A test to measure uric acid levels
Urinalysis
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal/kidney MRI
Abdominal X-rays
Kidney ultrasound
Once the stone is found, it should be analyzed to determine what type of stone it is.
Treatment
Most stones pass down the urinary tract on their own and are eventually expelled. Pain relievers, often potent ones, are needed to manage the pain. Increased fluid intake will help the stone to pass. Antibiotics may be given if the stone causes a urinary tract infection Stones that don’t pass need to be removed surgically. Dietary changes and drinking plenty of fluids are recommended to prevent recurrence.
When to Call for Help
If your child shows any signs suggestive of a kidney stone, call your pediatrician."
Blistering diseases,"What is a blister?
A blister is a bump on the skin containing fluid. Blisters are usually circular in shape. The fluid that forms underneath the skin can be bloody or clear.
What causes a blister?
Blisters are caused by injury, allergic reactions, or infections, which may include the following:
Burns and scalds
Sunburns
Friction (such as from a shoe)
Contact dermatitis
Impetigo (a contagious infection of the skin)
Viral infections (including chickenpox and herpes zoster)
Fungus
Thumb-sucking
Drugs reactions
The symptoms of a blister may resemble other skin conditions or medical problems. Always talk with your child's health care provider for a diagnosis.
First-aid for blisters
Blisters often heal spontaneously. Treatment will vary according to the cause. Some general guidelines for treatment may include:
Wash the area with soap and water.
A cold or ice pack may help reduce swelling and discomfort.
Keep the area clean and dry. Do not burst or puncture the blister.
If the blister bursts, place an adhesive bandage or dressing on the area to keep it clean.
Observe the area for signs of infection, like increased warmth, swelling, redness, drainage, pus formation, or pain. If you notice any signs of infection, call your child's health care provider. Antibiotics may be needed."
Blood clots,"What are blood clots?
Blood clots are clumps of coagulated blood. Clots are a natural part of healing, but can also be dangerous. If an internal blood clot breaks loose and travels through the circulatory system, it may become lodged in a blood vessel and block the flow of blood to vital organs. To prevent blood clots, many patients will be given medications, including antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs.
Symptoms
Swelling of an extremity, with change of skin color, chest pain or shortness of breath.
Diagnosis
Imaging studies, such as ultrasound, MRI or catheterizations.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the condition. Among the medications used to prevent unwanted clotting are antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs."
Brachial plexus injuries,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
The brachial plexus is a network of nerves in the shoulder that carries movement and sensory signals from the spinal cord to the arms and hands.
Brachial plexus injuries typically stem from trauma to the neck, and can cause pain, weakness and numbness in the arm and hand.
Brachial plexus injuries often heal well if they aren’t severe. Many people with minor brachial plexus injuries recover 90%–100% of the normal function of their arms.
In more severe brachial plexus injuries, surgery is often necessary to restore function.
If you have had an injury to the neck or shoulder area and you can’t feel or move your hand or arm, you should call your health care provider to find out what’s causing your symptoms"
Branchial cleft cyst,"What is a branchial cleft cyst?
Also, known as a cleft sinus, a branchial cleft cyst is a lump that develops in the neck or just below the collarbone. Branchial cleft cysts form during development of the embryo. They occur when tissues in the neck and collarbone area (branchial cleft) fail to develop normally. The birth defect may appear as open spaces called cleft sinuses, which may develop on one or both sides of the neck. A branchial cleft cyst may form from fluid drained from a sinus. The cyst or sinus can become infected. 
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Small pits, lumps or skin tags at either side of the neck or just below the collarbone 
Fluid drainage from a pit on the neck 
Diagnosis
Branchial cleft cysts can usually be diagnosed with a physical examination. Testing is usually not necessary.
Treatment
Infected branchial cleft cysts or sinuses require antibiotic treatment. If there are persistent problems with drainage or infection, these cysts should be surgically removed. Most branchial cleft remnants require no treatment. If surgery is required, results are usually good."
Brain and spinal tumors,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Brain tumors are the most common solid tumors affecting children and adolescents, with close to 5,000 children diagnosed each year.
Because of their location, some pediatric brain tumors and their required treatments can cause significant long-term impairment to intellectual and neurological function.
Some forms of brain cancer can be life-threatening."
Bronchiectasis,"What is bronchiectasis?
Bronchiectasis is a lung disease that usually results from an infection or other condition that injures the walls of the airways in your lungs. This injury is the beginning of a cycle in which your airways slowly lose their ability to clear out mucus, resulting in mucus buildup and an environment in which bacteria can grow. This leads to repeated serious lung infections that cause more damage to your airways. Over time, the airways become stretched out, flabby and scarred and unable to move air in and out. Bronchiectasis usually begins in childhood, but symptoms may not appear until months or even years after you have started having repeated lung infections.
Symptoms
The most common signs and symptoms are:
Daily cough, over months or years
Daily production of large amounts of mucus, or phlegm
Repeated lung infections
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Chest pain
Over time, more serious symptoms may develop, including:
Coughing up blood or bloody mucus
Weight loss
Fatigue
Sinus drainage
Bronchiectasis can also lead to other serious health conditions, including collapsed lung, heart failure and brain abscess.
Diagnosis
There is no one test for bronchiectasis. Even in its later stages, the signs of the disease are similar to those of other conditions, so those conditions must be ruled out.The most commonly used tests to diagnose bronchiectasis are:
Chest X-ray of the heart and lungs to detect any signs of infection and scarring of the airway walls
CT scan to provide a computer-generated image of the airways and other tissue in the lungs
Blood tests to detect a disease or condition that can lead to bronchiectasis (They can also reveal an infection or low levels of certain infection-fighting blood cells.)
Sputum culture to detect bacteria, fungi or tuberculosis
Lung function tests to measure how well the lungs move air in and out
Sweat test or other tests for cystic fibrosis
Treatment
The mainstays of treatment for bronchiectasis are:
Medications, especially antibiotics
Chest physical therapy
 "
Bronchiolitis,"What is Bronchiolitis?
Bronchiolitis is an inflammation of the bronchioles (small passages in the lungs) usually caused by a viral infection. The disease usually affects children under the age of 2, with a peak age of 3 to 6 months, and is a common, sometimes severe illness. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is one common cause. Other viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include parainfluenza, influenza, and adenovirus. 
Symptoms 
Cough, wheezing, shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing 
Rapid breathing (tachypnea) 
Nasal flaring in infants 
Fever (variable) 
Bluish skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis) 
Diagnosis 
Exams and tests to diagnose bronchiolitis include: 
A stethoscope examination of the chest to detect wheezing and crackling sounds. 
Chest X-ray and blood gases. 
Samples of nasal fluid may be cultured to determine what virus is present. 
Treatment
Antibiotics are not effective against viral infections. Sometimes, no treatment is necessary. Supportive therapy may include oxygen, humidified air, chest clapping (postural drainage to remove secretions), rest, and clear fluids. Other medicines used in the hospital may include albuterol (a medication normally used in asthma) or steroids. 
In extremely ill children, antiviral medications (such as ribavirin) are sometimes used. Antiviral treatment may decrease the severity and duration of the illness. To be effective, it must be administered early in the course of the illness. 
Prognosis
Usually, the symptoms have resolved within a week, and difficulty breathing usually improves by the third day. The mortality rate is less than 1 percent."
Bronchitis,"What is bronchitis?
Bronchitis is an inflammation of the main air passages (bronchi) to the lungs. Coughing often brings up yellow or greenish mucus. There are two main types of bronchitis: acute and chronic. Acute bronchitis, often caused by the same viruses that cause colds, usually starts as a sore throat, runny nose or sinus infection, then spreads to your airways. It can cause a lingering dry cough, but it usually goes away on its own. In chronic bronchitis, a type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the inflamed bronchi produce a lot of mucus, leading to cough and difficulty getting air in and out of the lungs. 
Symptoms
Symptoms of acute bronchitis include: 
Cough 
Shortness of breath 
Wheezing 
“Rattle” sensation in chest 
General ill feeling, or malaise 
Slight fever 
Tickle feeling in back of throat that leads to soreness 
Chest pain, soreness, and tightness in the chest 
Poor sleep 
Chills (uncommon) 
Symptoms of chronic bronchitis include: 
Cough that produces mucus (sputum), which may be blood streaked 
Shortness of breath aggravated by exertion or mild activity 
Frequent respiratory infections that worsen symptoms 
Wheezing 
Fatigue 
Headaches 
Diagnosis
Tests to diagnose acute and chronic bronchitis include: 
Physical exam 
Pulmonary function tests 
Arterial blood gas 
Chest X-ray 
Pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation testing) 
Complete blood count
Exercise testing 
Chest CT scan 
Treatment for Acute Bronchitis
Antibiotics usually aren't helpful because acute bronchitis is almost always caused by a virus, which will not respond to antibiotics. Antibiotics are usually only needed if your doctor diagnoses you with whooping cough or pneumonia. 
Medications called bronchodilators are used to open tight air passages in the lungs. Your doctor may prescribe this type of medicine if you are wheezing. 
Decongestants may also help relieve symptoms of bronchitis. Medications that loosen mucus can also be prescribed, but how well they work remains uncertain. 
Your doctor will tell you to drink more fluids to help thin mucus in the lungs, rest and soothe your airways by increasing humidity in the air with a cool mist humidifier. 
Symptoms will usually go away within seven to 14 days if you don't have chronic pulmonary disease. However, in some people it may take much longer for the cough to go away. 
Treatment for Chronic Bronchitis
There is no cure for chronic bronchitis. Treatments to relieve symptoms and prevent complications include: 
Inhaled medications that dilate (widen) the airways and decrease inflammation may help reduce symptoms such as wheezing.
Antibiotics to fight infections
Corticosteroids may occasionally be used during flare-ups of wheezing or in people with severe bronchitis that does not respond to other treatments. 
Oxygen therapy may be needed in severe cases. 
Treatment will help symptoms, but chronic bronchitis is a long-term condition that keeps coming back or never goes away completely. 
Prevention
Good handwashing is one of the best ways to avoid getting viruses and other respiratory infections. 
Since flu viruses have been shown to be a major cause of bronchitis, getting a flu shot may also help prevent acute bronchitis. 
Limit exposure to cold, damp environments."
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,"What is bronchopulmonary dysplasia?
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or BPD, is a serious lung condition that affects mostly babies who are born more than 10 weeks before their due date, weigh less than two and a half pounds, have breathing problems at birth and need long-term breathing support and oxygen. Many of these babies are born with serious respiratory distress syndrome because their lungs haven't yet developed enough to make surfactant, a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs and keeps them open so that the baby can breathe in air once he or she is born. Doctors believe that a baby gets bronchopulmonary dysplasia as a result of the way his or her lungs respond to things in the outside environment during the first hours or days after birth, including high levels of oxygen given newborns with breathing problems, pressure caused by mechanical ventilation and infections.
Symptoms
Most babies who get bronchopulmonary dysplasia are born with respiratory distress syndrome, which results in:
Rapid, shallow breathing
Sharp pulling in of the chest below the ribs with each breath
Grunting sounds during exhalation
Flaring of the nostrils during breathing
Diagnosis
It's hard to tell whether a baby with breathing problems has bronchopulmonary dysplasia before he or she is about 14 to 30 days old. At this point, the baby should show improved breathing, but instead the baby's condition seems to be getting worse and he or she needs more oxygen. Blood tests, chest X-ray and echocardiogram help doctors diagnose breathing problems correctly. BPD is graded as mild, moderate or severe, depending on how much extra oxygen the baby needs and how long he or she needs it.
Treatment
These babies are usually put on oxygen and a breathing machine at birth — either a ventilator (also known as a respirator) or a nasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) machine. This can prevent damage to their brains and other body organs from lack of oxygen. They also are given surfactant and medicines, including bronchodilators to improve the flow of air in and out of the lungs, diuretics to help remove extra fluid from the lungs and antibiotics to control infections.
Prognosis
Most babies with RDS begin to get better within the next 2 to 4 weeks, but some get worse and need more oxygen and/or breathing assistance from a machine. Babies who develop BPD also are more likely than other infants to have problems in other parts of their bodies that aren't yet fully developed, including the heart, kidneys, brain, stomach, intestines and eyes. With new and better treatments now available, most babies with BPD get better over time and many go on to live normal, active lives.
Prevention
Seeing your doctor regularly during your pregnancy, eating right, avoiding tobacco smoke, alcohol and illegal drugs, and controlling any ongoing medical conditions can help prevent BPD."
Burns,"The latest data show:
Unintentional injury is a leading cause of death among children under age 14.
Leading causes of accidental injury at home are burns, drowning, suffocation, choking, poisonings, falls, and firearms.
Burns and fires are the fifth most common cause of accidental death in children and adults, and account for an estimated 3,500 adult and child deaths per year.
Nearly 75% of all scalding burns in children are preventable.
Toddlers and children are more often burned by a scalding or flames.
Most children ages 4 and under who are hospitalized for burn-related injuries suffer from scald burn (65%) or contact burns (20%).
Hot tap water burns cause more deaths and hospitalizations than burns from any other hot liquids.
During the last 30 years, burn injuries have decreased for the following reasons:
Increased use of smoke detectors.
The flammability of consumer products, such as toys and pajamas, is federally regulated.
The US government monitors safety in the workplace.
A greater national emphasis is placed on burn injury prevention and fire safety.
A decrease in smoking helps prevent burn injuries.
New water heaters in homes and in public areas are now preset at lower temperatures to reduce scald injuries.
There are fewer open fires.
Age Most common injury type Risk factors
< 5 Years Flame Playing with matches, cigarette lighters, fires in fireplaces, barbecue pits, and trash fires
  Scald Kitchen injury from tipping scalding liquids.
Bathtub scalds often associated with lack of supervision or child abuse. Greatest number of pediatric burn patients are infants and toddlers younger than 3 years of age burned by scalding liquids.
5 to 10 Years Flame Male children are at increased risk, often due to fire play and risk-taking behaviors.
  Scald Female children are at increased risk, with most burns occurring in the kitchen or bathroom.
Adolescent Flame Injury associated with male peer-group activities involving gasoline or other flammable products, such as fireworks.
  Electrical Occurs most often in male adolescents involved in dare-type behaviors, such as climbing utility poles or antennae. In rural areas, burns may be caused by moving irrigation pipes that touch an electrical source.
Heat and cold injuries
Children are much more vulnerable to changes in the temperature of the environment because they produce and lose heat faster than adults. Because they are so often busy playing and having fun, children tend to pay less attention to when they are becoming too hot or too cold until problems occur. It is important for you to protect your child from the sun and from heat and cold exposures that may cause them illness or injury. Knowing what to do in case a burn or thermal injury occurs can help prevent a medical emergency.
Caring for a heat-induced or thermal burn
Remove the child from the heat source.
Cool the affected area with cold water or cold compresses until the pain is reduced or relieved.
If a blister has formed, do not break it.
Protect the burn with a dry, sterile, gauze bandage or with a clean bed sheet or cloth.
If your child's clothing is stuck to the burned area, do not attempt to remove it. Instead, cut around the clothing, leaving the burn intact. Seek medical care right away.
Do not apply any ointments, oils, or sprays to the burned area.
If your child has burns on the hand, foot, face, eyes, or groin, or those that cover a large area, seek medical attention or dial 911 for emergency medical attention.
Caring for an electrical burn
Any electrical burn should be seen by a doctor. Electrical burns cause damage to body parts below the skin that are not visible on the surface. Call or send someone to call 911 for emergency medical assistance if an electrical burn occurs.
Unplug the appliance or device that has caused the injury or turn off the electrical current.
If the child is in contact with the electrical current, do not touch them until you turn off the source or the circuit breaker.
Determine that the child is still breathing. If the child is not breathing, call or send someone to call 911 and then begin cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
Cover the burned area with a sterile gauze bandage or clean bed sheet.
Do not give your child anything to eat or drink.
Place the child on his or her back, unless a neck or back injury is suspected. If a neck or back injury is suspected, do not move the child until paramedics or emergency medical personnel are present.
If the child has vomited or has a serious injury to the face or mouth area, you may place the child on his or her side.
Keep your child warm with blankets or extra clothing, but do not use a heat source to warm him or her."
Cardiac arrhythmias,"What You Need to Know About Arrhythmias
Normally, special heart cells generate an electrical signal that travels through the heart. The electricity causes the heart muscle to contract, and that’s what makes a heartbeat.
An arrhythmia means the heart is not beating in the proper rhythm. This can cause anything from minor symptoms all the way to cardiac arrest and death.
Since different rhythm disturbances need different treatments, diagnosing the precise type of arrhythmia is important.
Advanced treatments include medication, destruction of cells that produce unusual signals and devices inserted into the body to generate proper heart rhythms.
When should I call an ambulance?
If someone experiences severe chest pain, shortness of breath, prolonged palpitations or racing heart
If someone loses consciousness. You may need to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if the heartbeat or breathing has stopped, and use an automated external defibrillator (AED)
What is an arrhythmia?
An arrhythmia is an abnormality in the timing or pattern of the heartbeat. When you have an arrhythmia, your heart may beat too quickly or too slowly, or you may experience an irregular rhythm in which your heart feels as if it is ""skipping a beat.""
Some types of arrhythmia may not be serious. Other types may be of great concern because they can cause fainting, heart failure or even sudden death. If you think you have an arrhythmia, consult your doctor.
How does a normal heart rhythm work?
The heart is a four-chambered muscle that pumps blood, which carries oxygen and nutrients, throughout the body. The two upper chambers of the heart, the right and left atria (plural of atrium), receive and collect the blood. The lower chambers, the right and left ventricles, pump the blood to other parts of the body.
The right atrium receives oxygen-depleted blood from the body and pushes it to the right ventricle. The right ventricle pumps blood through the pulmonary artery to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen.
In the same beat, the left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pushes it to the left ventricle. The left ventricle pumps it through a large artery, called the aorta, to the rest of the body.
Heart Rhythms Depend on Electricity
The heart uses muscle contractions to pump blood through the body. A small burst of electricity causes the muscle to contract.
In normal heart function, an electrical impulse starts in the upper right chamber of the heart in the sinus node (sinoatrial node), often thought of as the heart’s natural pacemaker. The sinus node is a group of specialized cells capable of generating a momentary electrical current. The current spreads through the atria (upper chambers), causing them to contract and squeeze blood into the ventricles (lower chambers).
The electrical signal then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, located between the atria and the ventricles. The AV node delays the signal for a fraction of a second. This delay allows the ventricles time to fill completely with blood.
Once the ventricles are filled, the electrical impulse travels rapidly through the bundle of His, a network of specialized fibers. The bundle of His splits into the right and left bundle branches, which conduct the electrical impulse into the right and left ventricles. With that burst of electricity, the ventricles contract and pump blood out to the body.
Normally, the heart’s electrical system triggers the resting heart to beat in this precise sequence 60 to 100 times each minute. This is referred to as normal sinus rhythm. With exercise, the heart rate will increase to above 100 times per minute. A person’s peak heart rate can be calculated by subtracting their age from 220. For example, the peak heart rate for a 40 year old is 220 − 40 = 180.
What are the symptoms of arrhythmia?
Cardiac arrhythmias may cause a wide variety of symptoms, such as:
Palpitations: a racing, skipping or fluttering sensation in your chest
Dizziness or light-headedness
Fainting
Low blood pressure
Chest pain
Shortness of breath
Fatigue
Heart failure: heart can’t pump enough oxygenated blood through the body
Cardiac arrest: heart stops beating
Difficulty feeding (in infants)
Sometimes arrhythmias are silent, meaning they cause no obvious symptoms. A doctor can detect an irregular heartbeat during a physical exam by taking your pulse, listening to your heart or by performing diagnostic tests.
What are the different types of arrhythmias?
Palpitations: heartbeat that is out of rhythm. Occurs when the electrical signal does not originate from the sinus node
Supraventricular tachycardia — rapid heartbeat involving the atria (upper chambers of the heart). There are several types of supraventricular tachycardia:
Atrial fibrillation: ineffective contractions of the atria caused by rapid, irregular signals from multiple sites in the upper half of the heart
Atrial tachycardia: rapid beating of the atria, much faster than the ventricles, due to a ""short circuit"" in the upper half of the heart
Atrial flutter: extremely rapid beating of the atria (between 240 and 340 times per minute) due to a ""short circuit"" in the upper half of the heart
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT): rapid heartbeat caused by a ""short circuit"" resulting from an extra electrical pathway in the heart
Ventricular tachycardia: rapid, inefficient contractions of the ventricles
Bradycardia: slow heartbeat due to a failing sinus node or a blockage in the electrical circuit
What causes arrhythmia?
Arrhythmias have many different causes. Here are some examples:
Congenital abnormality of the heart’s electrical system: For example, some patients are born with an abnormal muscle fiber connecting the upper and lower chambers of the heart. The presence of this extra fiber can lead to paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) later in life.
Inherited heart disease that causes abnormalities over time, setting the stage for an arrhythmia. One example is arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD): Patients with this inherited condition are born with normal hearts. But over time the heart muscle is replaced by fat and scar tissue, which can cause arrhythmias.
Acquired conditions: A heart attack, for example, can cause part of the heart muscle to turn to scar. Scar tissue may be the site of a ""short circuit"" and set the stage for ventricular tachycardia.
Changes over time: The heart may change as years pass, eventually developing an arrhythmia. The best example is atrial fibrillation, which is rare before age 50 but increases dramatically afterward. By the age of 80, one person in 10 has atrial fibrillation. 
How are arrhythmias diagnosed?
Some diagnostic tests take place on site in a doctor’s office or hospital. Other tests provide monitoring at home as you follow your daily routine. Click each method to learn more.
On-Site Diagnostic Tests
Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG): wires taped to various parts of your body to create a graph of your heart’s electrical rhythm
Exercise stress test: ECG recorded while strenuously exercising
Echocardiogramor transesophageal echocardiogram: ultrasound of the heart
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): imaging of the heart that does not involve radiation and can diagnose certain rare heart conditions
Computed tomography (CT): high-resolution X-rays; can be performed extremely quickly (ultrafast CT scans), which results in very low radiation exposure
Tilt table test: measurement of heart rate and blood pressure in response to upright tilt, which simulates prolonged standing; used to diagnose syncope (fainting)
Electrophysiology study (EP): test that examines the heart’s electrical activity from the inside; used to diagnose many heart rhythm disorders and performed prior to catheter ablation
In-Home Diagnostic Monitors
Holter monitor: a portable ECG you wear continuously from one to seven days to record your heart rhythms over time
Event monitor: a portable ECG you wear for one or two months, which records only when triggered by an abnormal heart rhythm or when you manually activate it
Implantable monitor: a tiny event monitor with a battery life of several years, inserted under your skin to record very occasional events
How are arrhythmias treated?
Treatment decisions are based on a thorough analysis of your condition, medical history, lifestyle and other factors. Click each treatment to learn more.
Procedures
Catheter ablation: procedure to cauterize the specific heart cells that cause abnormal heart rhythms
Cardioversion: procedure delivering a precisely controlled shock to your heart to “reset” an atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter; performed under anesthesia
Medications
Your doctor may recommend medications based on your type of arrhythmia, medical history and current medications and medical conditions
Implanted devices
Pacemakers: inserted under the skin below the collarbone, pacemakers deliver regular electrical pulses through thin, highly durable wires attached to the heart. Pacemakers are used to treat bradycardia, heart block and some types of heart failure
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs): a small implanted device that delivers an electrical pulse to the heart to reset a dangerously irregular heartbeat. Often used to treat ventricular tachycardia or heart failure
Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT): a pacemaker or ICD used to treat certain types of heart failure that are caused by dyssynchronous contractions (when the chambers of heart beat out of time with each other)
Lifestyle changes
Controlling hypertension
Losing weight
Limiting alcohol
Treating sleep apnea

Celiac disease,"Celiac disease is a digestive problem that hurts your small intestine. It stops your body from taking in nutrients from food.
You may have celiac disease if you are sensitive to gluten. Gluten is a kind of protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and sometimes in small amounts in mixed oats.
When you have celiac disease and you eat foods with gluten, your body has a reaction that is not normal. The part of your body that fights disease (the immune system) starts to hurt your small intestine. It attacks the tiny bumps (villi) that line your small intestine.
The villi help your body take in nutrients from food into your bloodstream. Without the villi, your small intestine can’t get enough nutrients, no matter how much food you eat.
Celiac disease is genetic. This means it can be passed down from parent to child.
More than 2 million Americans have been diagnosed with celiac disease. Studies show that as many as 1 in every 133 Americans may have it. They may not know they have it.
Celiac disease is more common in people:
Whose ancestors came from Europe
Who are white
Who have type 1 diabetes
Who have Down syndrome
Who have other autoimmune diseases
Who are infertile
Who have irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea
What causes celiac disease?
Celiac disease is a genetic disease that runs in families. You may have celiac disease and not know it because you don’t have any symptoms.
Some things that may make symptoms start to appear are:
Too much stress
Pregnancy
Surgery
Physical injury
Infection
Childbirth
What are the symptoms of celiac disease?
Celiac disease affects people in different ways. Some have symptoms as children. Others have symptoms only as adults. Some people have diarrhea and belly (abdominal) pain. Others may feel moody or depressed.
Each person’s symptoms may vary. Common signs of celiac disease include:
Constant (chronic) diarrhea or constipation
Weight loss
Gas
Pale, bad-smelling stool
Unexplained low blood count that makes you feel tired (anemia)
Tingling, numb feeling in the legs
Missed menstrual periods (linked to too much weight loss)
Infertility
Early osteoporosis or fractures
Teeth changing color or losing their enamel
Celiac disease can be painful. Some common pain symptoms are:
Stomach pain or swelling (bloating) that keeps coming back
Muscle cramps or bone pain
Pain in the joints
Painful, itchy skin rash
Children who have celiac disease may not grow at a normal rate.
You may have celiac disease but not have any symptoms. That is because the part of your small intestine that is not hurt can still take in enough nutrients. But you may still be at risk for problems of the disease.
Celiac disease symptoms may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider to be sure.
How is celiac disease diagnosed?
Celiac disease can be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms may look like symptoms of other digestive problems such as:
Crohn's disease
Irritable bowel syndrome
Ulcerative colitis
Infected colon (diverticulitis)
Intestinal infections
Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth
To see if you have celiac disease, your healthcare provider will look at your past health and do a physical exam. You may also have tests such as:
Blood work. This is done to check the level of infection-fighting cells (antibodies) you have to gluten in your blood. People with celiac disease have higher than normal levels of these cells. Your immune system makes these cells to help fight things (such as gluten) that the body feels are a danger.
Biopsy. This is the most accurate way to tell if you have celiac disease. A tissue sample (biopsy) is taken from your small intestine to check for damage to the villi. To do this, a long, thin tube (endoscope) is placed in your mouth, down to your stomach and into your small intestine. A tissue sample is taken using tools passed through the tube. The sample is checked in a lab.
What is the treatment for celiac disease?
If you have celiac disease, you must stop eating gluten. Eating gluten will do more damage to your small intestine. Eliminating gluten is the only treatment for this disease. You must not eat gluten for the rest of your life.

In most cases, taking gluten out of your diet will stop your symptoms. And, any damage to your intestine will heal. It will also stop any more damage from happening.

Removing gluten from your diet can be difficult. This is because gluten can contaminate many foods. It can be found in condiments, salad dressings, and other unexpected places. For this reason, your healthcare provider may refer you to a dietitian who specializes in celiac disease.

After you stop eating foods with gluten, your symptoms will likely get better in a few days. Your small intestine should heal completely in 3 to 6 months. Your villi will be back and working again. If you are older, it may take up to 2 years for your body to heal.

Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy, the most common childhood physical disability, is caused by damage to the brain before birth or in infancy. People living with cerebral palsy can have neurological and musculoskeletal problems that affect posture, sensory perceptions, communication, movement and other functions.
Cerebral Palsy: What You Need to Know
Injuries to the brain before, during or after birth can cause cerebral palsy.
Symptoms of cerebral palsy are usually first noticed in infants and toddlers.
Almost half the children affected by cerebral palsy develop hypertonia (excessive muscle tension) or spasticity (excessive muscle tension with increased tendon reflexes).
There is currently no cure for cerebral palsy, but treatment can address associated neurologic, orthopaedic and medical conditions.
What is cerebral palsy?
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition that affects movement and muscle tone. The exact cause, in many cases, is unknown, but the disorder occurs when there is abnormal development or damage to areas in the brain that control motor function. CP develops in approximately three out of every 1,000 live births.
What causes cerebral palsy?
Several types of injuries can damage the parts of the brain that control motor function, including:
Preterm birth: the most common cause in the United States
Head injuries including shaken baby syndrome
Infections of the brain or spinal cord
Obstructed oxygen flow to the brain, such as in near-drowning experiences
Events that block blood flow to the brain, such as stroke
Malnutrition
Heavy metal ingestion
What are the symptoms of cerebral palsy?
Children with CP usually show signs of motor delay before age two. CP is often not formally diagnosed until age 2 or 3. Babies with cerebral palsy are often slow to reach developmental milestones, such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl or walk. They may also have certain reflexes present that normally disappear in early infancy. 
The symptoms of CP may resemble other conditions. Although each child exhibits a unique pattern of deficits, there are some common signs. 
You may notice that your child is showing exaggerated reflexes or floppiness in the trunk or limbs. Another sign is spasticity, which may show up as shaking or stiffness in the trunk, arms or  legs or clenched fists. Uncontrolled movements and abnormal gait may be part of the picture as well. 
Children with CP may have additional problems, including the following:
Seizures
Vision, hearing and/or speech problems
Learning disorders and behavior problems
Intellectual or developmental disabilities
Respiratory problems
Gastrointestinal and nutrition issues
Bowel and bladder problems
Bone abnormalities, including scoliosis (a sideways curvature and rotation of the back bones) and hip dysplasia (dislocation)
What are the different types of cerebral palsy?
Cerebral palsy is classified according to which part of the body is affected. The spasticity of CP can present itself in three ways:
Spastic diplegia involves the legs more than the arms. This type is more likely to affect babies born preterm, before 32 weeks.
Spastic quadriplegia involves all four limbs more or less equally. Full-term or preterm babies with CP may have this type.
Spastic hemiplegia involves one side of the body, and may occur in children who have had one or more bleeding episodes in the brain’s ventricles.
Cerebral Palsy Treatment
There is no cure for CP, but there are many treatment options to help with the problems associated with the condition.
Baclofen—Baclofen is a muscle relaxant that can be given orally or directly into the cerebrospinal fluid in the spine through a baclofen pump surgically placed into the abdomen.
Therapeutic electrical stimulation (TES) —TES is a type of electrical stimulation that increases blood flow to weakened muscles.
Selective Dorsal Rhizotomy (SDR) —Selective dorsal rhizotomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting some of the lumbar and sacral sensory nerve fibers that come from the muscles and enter the spinal cord. The operation may reduce spasticity when used in conjunction with an intense course of physical therapy following surgery.
Orthopaedic Issues Associated with Cerebral Palsy
Hip Dysplasia
Hip dysplasia is a deformity of the hip that can be found on one or both hips in children with an underlying neuromuscular condition such as CP. Increased or decreased tone in the muscles can lead to migration of the femoral head out of the hip socket, requiring additional treatment, such as proximal femoral osteotomy or acetabular osteotomy.
Neuromuscular Scoliosis
Neuromuscular scoliosis is a condition of the spine associated with an underlying neuromuscular condition, such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy or spinal cord injury. The underlying condition typically causes changes in the muscles, leaving them unable to support the spine adequately. This leads to a curvature of the spine. The typical presentation is an abnormal S- or C-shaped curvature. The spine can also have rotation, creating a multidimensional curve. The curvature can be progressive, especially with growth spurts. Treatment may include bracing or spinal fusion surgery.
Talipes Equinovarus Foot (Clubfoot)
Clubfoot is commonly seen in children with CP. Due to muscle imbalance, the deformity can make weight-bearing activities challenging. Surgical procedures your doctor may recommend include split anterior tibial tendon transfer or calcaneal osteotomy
Neuromuscular Flatfoot
This is a deformity of the foot due to an underlying neuromuscular condition. The abnormality of the muscles in the feet leads to a flat foot with minimal or no arch. This condition is commonly seen in children with hypotonia or low muscle tone. Braces or orthotic devices may provide arch support and decrease pain, or surgery may be recommended to address the problem.
Toe Walking
Toe walking is a condition in children with an underlying neuromuscular disorder that leads to high tone or muscle tightness in a child’s ankles, and can cause them to walk on the toes or balls of the feet. Physical therapy can be beneficial, as can a series of casts that gradually reposition the foot and ankle. Your doctor may recommend surgical lengthening of the Achilles tendon or gastrocnemius if these approaches are not effective.
Limb Length Inequality
Limb length inequality is a difference in the lengths of a child’s lower extremities (legs). The difference in length can be found in children with hemiplegic CP. For slight discrepancies of leg length, a shoe lift may be helpful. For more pronounced differences, surgical treatment may be recommended to shorten the longer leg and provide more balance in leg length as your child grows.
Torsional Disorders
Some children with CP develop an inward or outward twist in the bones of their lower extremities, including internal tibial torsion. When this is excessive, it can interfere with their gait pattern. A surgical procedure called rotational osteotomy can correct the deformity.
Muscle Contracture
Children with a neuromuscular disorder can exhibit increased muscle tone that leads to a contracture of the muscle, preventing it from stretching well. The hamstrings, adductors, hip flexors and gastrocnemii can be affected by contracture. Physical therapy, bracing, botulinum injections or tendon lengthening surgery may be necessary to provide relief.

Chest pain,"Chest pain tends to be associated with heart attack or other acute heart conditions in adults. But what about chest pain in children? Parents should know that childhood chest pain is actually a fairly common complaint and it’s rarely an indication of a heart condition.
""Only about 1% to 4% of chest pain in children will be cardiac. The vast majority—95% or more—isn’t related to a heart issue,” explains William Ravekes, M.D., Medical Director of Pediatric Heart Transplant at Johns Hopkins Children’s Center.
Causes of Chest Pain in Children
Some of the most common causes of chest pain in children include:
Acid reflux (heartburn)
Anxiety
Asthma
Costochondritis (inflammation of joints between ribs and breastbone)
Muscle strain
Respiratory infection"
Chest wall malformations,"What is pectus excavatum?
Pectus excavatum (PE), translated literally as “hollowed chest” and also referred to as ""sunken chest"" or ""funnel chest,"" is the most common chest wall deformity seen in children. An overgrowth of the rib cartilages before and after birth causes the characteristic depression of the sternum (breastbone). The cause of PE is not known, but often the tendency to develop PE runs in families. Depending on the seriousness of the defect, PE may cause poor posture with slumped shoulders and a protruding abdomen or ""pot belly,"" as well as possible problems with bone growth and alignment later in life. In severe cases, PE shifts the heart to the left side of the chest and compresses the lungs, limiting the child's ability to take deep breaths. This defect commonly worsens during puberty until age 18 when most of the growth spurt is complete. "
Child abuse and neglect,"What is child abuse and neglect?
Physical abuse is when a child is hit, slapped, beaten, burned or otherwise physically harmed. Like other forms of abuse, physical abuse usually continues for a long time.
Sexual abuse is when a child is engages in a sexual situation with an adult or an older child. Sometimes this means direct sexual contact, such as intercourse, or other genital contact or touching. But it can also mean that the child is made to watch sexual acts, look at an adult's genitals, look at pornography or be part of the production of pornography. Children many times are not forced into the sexual situation but rather persuaded, bribed, tricked or coerced.
Emotional or psychological abuse is when a child is regularly threatened, yelled at, humiliated, ignored, blamed or otherwise emotionally mistreated. For example, making fun of a child, calling a child names and always finding fault with the child are forms of emotional or psychological abuse.
Neglect is when a child's basic needs are not met. These needs include nutritious food, adequate shelter, clothing, cleanliness, emotional support, love and affection, education, safety and medical and dental care.
Symptoms
Unexplained burns, bites, bruises, broken bones or black eyes may signal the presence of child abuse or neglect. Also, the child:
Shows sudden changes in behavior or school performance
Has not received help for physical or medical problems brought to the parents’ attention
Has learning problems that cannot be attributed to specific physical or psychological causes
Is always watchful, as though preparing for something bad to happen
Lacks adult supervision
Is overly compliant, passive or withdrawn
Comes to school or other activities early, stays late and does not want to go home"
Cholesteatoma,"What is cholesteatoma?
Cholesteatoma is a skin-containing cyst or growth located in or near the middle ear. The growth can be either present at birth (congenital) or can form later in childhood, sometimes as a complication of chronic ear infections.
Symptoms
Drainage from the ear
Hearing loss in one ear
Pain in the ear
Dizziness
Diagnosis
An ear exam with a device called otoscope to look inside the ear and check for abnormalities of the ear drum is required. Specialized examination of the ear with a microscope, CT scan and hearing tests may be helpful.
Treatment
The typical treatment is surgery. If untreated, cholesteatomas can lead to deafness, facial nerve paralysis and other complications affecting the brain.
When to Call for Help
Call your pediatrician if you notice any of the symptoms listed above in your child."
Chronic kidney disease,"What You Need to Know
You have two kidneys, located near the middle of your back, just below the rib cage. Each is about the size of your fist. Tiny structures called nephrons are inside each kidney and they filter the blood. There are about a million of them.
The kidneys are responsible for removing wastes, toxins and extra water from the body; balancing important salts and minerals in the blood; and releasing hormones to help control blood pressure, manage anemia and help maintain strong bones. The waste and extra water removed by the kidneys become urine. The urine flows through tubes called ureters. It goes to your bladder, which stores the urine until you go to the bathroom.
When the kidneys are damaged, they can't filter blood as they should. The result can be a build-up of wastes in your body, as well as other problems that can harm your health.
One in three American adults is at high risk for developing kidney disease today. Yet most aren’t able to identify the signs and symptoms. One in nine American adults has kidney disease and most don’t know it.
At first, kidney disease is silent. Symptoms often don’t appear until the kidneys are badly damaged. Many people don't have any symptoms until their kidney disease is advanced. Blood and urine tests are the only way to know if you have kidney disease. 
What is chronic kidney disease?
Chronic kidney disease, sometimes called CKD, is an umbrella term for several conditions that affect the kidneys, but it generally means permanent — and usually progressive — damage to the kidneys caused by a variety of conditions."
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),"What is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?
COPD is a term that refers to a group of lung diseases that can interfere with normal breathing. According to the American Lung Association, more than 13 million Americans suffer from COPD. It is the third leading cause of death in the U.S.
What are the different types of COPD?
The two most common conditions of COPD are chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Some doctors agree that asthma should be classified as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, while others do not. A brief description of asthma is included below:
What is chronic bronchitis?
Chronic bronchitis means long-term inflammation of the bronchi (the breathing passages in the lungs), which results in increased production of mucus, as well as other changes.
These changes may result in breathing problems, frequent infections, cough, and disability.
What is pulmonary emphysema?
Emphysema is a chronic lung condition in which alveoli (the air sacs in the lungs) may become:
Destroyed
Narrowed
Collapsed
Stretched
Overinflated
This can cause a decrease in respiratory function and breathlessness. Damage to the air sacs is irreversible and results in permanent ""holes"" in the lung tissue.
What is asthma?
Asthma is a chronic, inflammatory lung disease involving recurrent breathing problems. The characteristics of asthma include the following:
The lining of the airways becomes swollen and inflamed.
The muscles that surround the airways tighten.
The production of mucus is increased, leading to mucus plugs.
What causes COPD?
The causes of COPD are not fully understood. It is generally agreed that the most important cause of chronic bronchitis and emphysema is cigarette smoking. Other causes such as air pollution and occupational exposures may play a role, especially when combined with cigarette smoking. Heredity may also be a factor.
Are there rehabilitation programs for COPD?
The goals of COPD rehabilitation programs include helping the patient return to the highest level of function and independence possible, while improving the overall quality of the person's physical, emotional, and social life. Attaining these goals help people with COPD live more comfortably by improving endurance, providing relief of symptoms, and preventing progression of the disease with minimal side effects.
In order to reach these goals, COPD rehabilitation programs may include the following:
Medication management
Exercises to decrease respiratory symptoms and improve muscle strength and endurance
Respiratory treatments to improve breathing ability
Assistance with obtaining respiratory equipment and portable oxygen
Methods to increase independence with activities of daily living (ADLs)
Exercises for physical conditioning and improved endurance
Stress management, relaxation exercises, and emotional support
Smoking cessation programs
Nutritional counseling
Patient and family education and counseling
Vocational counseling
Who is on the COPD rehabilitation team?
COPD rehabilitation programs can be conducted on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Many skilled professionals are part of the pulmonary rehabilitation team, including the following:
Pulmonologist
Respiratory therapist
Physiatrist
Internist
Rehabilitation nurse
Dietitian
Physical therapist
Occupational therapist
Social worker
Psychologist/psychiatrist
Recreational therapist
Case manager
Chaplain
Vocational therapist
Most COPD health professionals consider the patient and his or her family part of the rehabilitation team. In fact, in order to develop the most appropriate care possible, many teams refer to the need for equal ""partnerships"" between patients and medical teams."
Churg-Strauss syndrome,"What is Churg-Strauss syndrome?
Churg-Strauss syndrome is a systemic vasculitis.
Symptoms
Asthma symptoms
Nerve tingling, numbness, pain
Vasculitis: nasal polyps, rashes, skin nodules
Wasting
Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires careful clinical evaluation, including detailed family history, blood tests, imaging studies, nerve conduction tests and tissue biopsies.
Treatment
Churg-Strauss syndrome usually responds to prednisone or other immunosuppressive drugs.
 "
Circadian rhythm disorders,"What are circadian rhythm disorders? 
Circadian rhythm disorders are disruptions in a person's circadian rhythm — another name for the body’s internal clock that regulates a variety of biological processes. Brain wave activity, hormone production, cell regeneration and other biological activities are linked to this 24-hour cycle. Circadian rhythm disorders can be caused by many factors, including changes in routine, medications and time zone changes."
Cirrhosis,"Acute Liver Failure
This alarming syndrome usually occurs in a previously well infant, child or adolescent and can be caused by a number of infectious or metabolic causes and reactions to medication.
Jaundice occurs rapidly, often in concert with gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and fever.
We are committed to serving children with this disorder as soon as we are notified and work with our emergency transport team, intensive care specialists and if necessary, our pediatric liver surgeons to provide 24-hour care for the best outcome possible for children with this condition.
What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an inherited disease in which a protein known as A1AT is unable to be released from the liver into the blood in adequate amounts. This causes a deficiency of the A1AT protein in the circulation. A1AT is a specialized protein that blocks the action of other proteins important in inflammation (swelling) and breakdown of tissues in the body. When the A1AT protein is deficient in the circulation, tissue inflammation and tissue damage is more severe, especially in the lungs. The defective A1AT protein that remains in the liver may cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) that can progress to cirrhosis (permanent liver scarring) and liver failure.
A1AT deficiency is quite common, with about 1 in 1,500 to 2,000 people affected. Both parents must be carriers of the genetic defect to have a child with A1AT deficiency. Although carrier parents partially produce the abnormal A1AT protein, they usually have no — or very minimal — symptoms and they may not realize they are partially affected until their child is diagnosed with the condition.
Symptoms
About 10 percent of newborns with liver disease will be diagnosed with A1AT deficiency. Newborns may develop jaundice as part of inflammation of the liver associated with A1AT deficiency. Older children and teens can present with a liver that has been inflamed for a long time, causing scarring (cirrhosis) to develop. Lung disease usually develops only in adulthood. Adults with A1AT deficiency may have difficulties with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, coughing and repeated lung infections.
Diagnosis
Testing is usually done when a child has liver inflammation of uncertain cause or when a family history suggests A1AT liver disease. The standard screening test is to measure the amount of A1AT protein in the circulation. In cases of A1AT deficiency, the serum A1AT level will be low. When a low A1AT level is found, an additional test is usually done to identify the types of abnormal A1AT proteins that are in the circulation. In rare cases, a more detailed analysis of the DNA in the gene may be necessary.
The amount of liver swelling and damage can be assessed by ultrasonography (sonogram) of the abdomen, blood tests of liver inflammation and function and a liver biopsy, where a small piece of liver tissue is obtained and then examined under the microscope to search for changes typical of A1AT deficiency.
Treatment
There is no cure for A1AT deficiency. Therapy involves controlling symptoms and attempting to prevent the development of complications. To protect their lungs, it is very important that the affected person and those around them not smoke. Vaccinations to protect against viruses, such as hepatitis A and hepatitis B, that can further damage the liver should be given. It is difficult to predict how severely a liver will be affected. Liver function tests are followed over time. Some patients may have minimal liver disease during their entire lifetime; however, a small number will eventually require liver transplant.
Cirrhosis or Chronic Liver Failure
Cirrhosis or chronic liver failure can be caused by a number of the liver and biliary diseases listed in Clinical Services or sometimes appear without known cause. Our approach to pediatric patients with this problem is to start with a thorough history and physical examination and nutritional assessment.
We also have a frank discussion with the patient and family about what is involved in the evaluation for a life-saving liver transplant.
Liver Cyst or Tumor
There are multiple benign and malignant malformations or tumors that can occur in the liver of a child.
Our approach begins with a thorough review of medical records and imaging studies. We work closely with our interventional radiologists and surgeons to establish an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible.
If the diagnosis is a malignant tumor, then we work with the pediatric oncologists and pediatric surgeons to decide the very best approach, which may include chemotherapy, radiation, embolization, surgical removal and/or liver transplantation."
Cleft lip and cleft palate,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Cleft lip and cleft palate are among the most common congenital facial differences (or birth defects) in children.
These birth differences arise when the tissues and bone inside the mouth do not fuse properly, resulting in a space in the upper lip and/or palate.
Both cleft lip and cleft palate surgeries are performed in the hospital under general anesthesia and usually require a stay of at least one night."
Cloacal exstrophy,"What is cloacal exstrophy?
Cloacal exstrophy is a rare congenital malformation that can be diagnosed antenatally. The pattern of inheritance is unknown due to the small number of patients. The hindgut and cecum is exstrophied between two halves of the bladder. There is prolapse of the ileum and the handgut is blind ending. There is significant diastasis of the pubic symphysis and the phallus is also separated into two halves along with the scrotum. This is a rare disorder and is found in one in 400,000 births.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis can easily be made prenatally as both the bladder and intestine are open anteriorly and oftentimes the spine is open posteriorly.
Associated conditions: Abnormalities of the kidneys are more frequently noted. The testes may not come down into the scrotum (sac). In the female child, the vagina may be absent, and the clitoris is split into two halves. A higher incidence of renal anomalies is seen in patients with cloacal exstrophy. Genital anomalies include absent or bifid phallus. Vaginal absence may also be noted. Anomalies of the extremities, cardiovascular system, bowel, vertebrae and diaphragm also have been seen.
Treatment
Modern staged repair has been utilized in the treatment of cloacal exstrophy. Initial assessment of the neonate should focus on stabilizing the medical status and determining if associated anomalies make reconstruction ethically advisable.
A primary repair is done soon after birth if the child is robust and healthy. The bladder is closed and the pelvic bones are brought together into their normal ring structure. The bowel is brought out to a stoma (bag) on the wall of the abdomen. If the baby cannot tolerate a procedure of this magnitude, the bowel is removed from the abdominal wall, the bladder halves are simply brought together and a colostomy is performed.
Continence procedure: If bladder closure is delayed because of associated defects, closure is performed at one year of age. At four to seven years of age, a procedure to establish urinary continence is performed. This involves the reconstruction of the outlet of the bladder to prevent urine leakage. The ureters (tubes from the kidneys to the bladder) are also repositioned. The bowel may be used to further increase the size of the bladder in those patients that have a small bladder size.
Adolescent repair is performed at the time of adolescence. This involves the construction of a vagina or the enlargement of the vagina in those children with a narrow vagina.
The treatment protocols and the timing of procedure requires individualization based on the extent of the defect noted. The use of multidisciplinary approach at a large center is the key to good functional and cosmetic results with decreased morbidity. 
Follow-up
Follow-up is intensive and long-term. Most patients should be referred to a large center where facilities are available for the care of complex birth defects.

Clubfoot,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Clubfoot most often presents at birth.
Clubfoot is caused by a shortened Achilles tendon, which causes the foot to turn in and under.
Clubfoot is twice as common in boys.
Treatment is necessary to correct clubfoot and is usually done in two phases — casting and bracing.
Children with clubfoot should be able to take part in regular daily activities once the condition is treated."
Coagulation disorders,"What are coagulation disorders?
Coagulations disorders are conditions that affect the blood’s clotting activities. Hemophilia, Von Willebrand disease, clotting factor deficiencies, hypercoagulable states and deep venous thrombosis are all coagulations disorders. Hemophilia and Von Willebrand disease are among the best known.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome,"What is congenital central hypoventilation syndrome?
Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), also known as “Ondine’s curse,” is a rare neurological disorder characterized by inadequate breathing during sleep and in more severely affected individuals, during waking periods as well. This disorder is associated with a malfunction of the nerves that control involuntary body functions and abnormal development of early embryonic cells that form the spinal cord.
Symptoms
Infants born with CCHS may have the following symptoms:
Poor breathing or complete lack of spontaneous breathing, especially during sleep
Abnormal pupils
Feeding difficulty due to acid reflux and decreased intestinal motility
Absent or impaired bowel function (Hirschsprung’s disease)
Diagnosis
A sleep study is performed to determine how severe the breathing difficulty is. Respiratory, cardiac and neurological tests are done to rule out other disorders. Early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent serious complications caused by periods of low or no oxygen.
Treatment
Treatment focuses on providing breathing support, usually through the use of a respirator, or ventilator. Some children with CCHS will need a ventilator 24 hours per day; others may only need breathing help when sleeping. In some individuals, a surgical implant in the diaphragm muscle can allow electrical stimulation of the muscle to control breathing.
Prognosis
Children with CCHS are able to lead active lives but need close supervision while swimming or playing in pools, since their bodies may “forget” to breathe while underwater. CCHS is a lifelong condition, but with proper treatment it does not alter life expectancy."
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,"What is congenital diaphragmatic hernia?
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) occurs when there is a hole in the diaphragm, which is the thin sheet of muscle separating the chest from the abdomen. When this gap forms during a fetus’s development in the womb, the bowel, stomach or even the liver can move into the chest cavity. The presence of these abdominal organs in the chest limits the space for the lungs and can result in respiratory complications. Because CDH forces the lungs to grow in a compressed state, several aspects of their function may not develop normally until after the birth of the baby.
Congenital diaphragmatic hernia and pulmonary hypoplasia
A baby with CDH may suffer from a form of underdeveloped lungs known as pulmonary hypoplasia.
When pulmonary hypoplasia occurs, there are abnormalities that impact:
The number of air sacs (alveoli) available for air entry into the lungs
The distance that oxygen has to travel to reach the blood vessels in the lungs
The amount of blood that can be carried in the blood vessels in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)
Before birth, the placenta takes over all functions of the lungs so a fetus can grow in the womb without suffering low oxygen levels (hypoxemia). However, after birth, the baby depends on the function of the lungs, and if their underdevelopment is severe, artificial ventilation techniques will be necessary. CDH can appear on the left side, right side or rarely on both sides of the chest. CDH occurs in about 1 in 2500 live births."
Congenital head and neck masses,"What are congenital head and neck masses?
Congenital head and neck masses are lumps (cysts) in the neck, face, scalp or ear that are present at birth. Many of these should be removed to prevent infection. The most common congenital head and neck masses are dermoid cysts, branchial cleft cysts and thyroglossal duct cysts.
Dermoid cysts are usually found on the scalp, face or neck. Dermoid cysts need to be removed because they can grow larger or become infected.
Branchial cleft cysts develop in the neck of young children. Branchial cleft cysts are surgically removed to prevent infection.
Thyroglossal duct cysts are lumps in the middle of the neck near the Adam’s apple or under the chin. Removal is typically required to prevent infection.
Symptoms
Symptoms include lumps or bumps anywhere on the scalp, neck and head.
Diagnosis
Physical exam
Ultrasound
CT scan or other imaging
Biopsy or removal
Treatment
Many lesions are removed with surgery.
When to Call for Help
Call your pediatrician if you notice any of the above symptoms in your child."
Congenital nephrotic syndrome,"What is congenital nephrotic syndrome?
Congenital nephrotic syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by protein in the urine and swelling of the body, occurs primarily in families of Finnish origin and develops shortly after birth. The disorder commonly results in infection, malnutrition and kidney failure. It can often lead to death by five years of age.
Symptoms
Symptoms include low birth weight, body swelling, decreased urine output, foamy appearance of urine, poor appetite and cough.
Diagnosis
An examination reveals massive fluid retention and generalized swelling. Abnormal sounds are heard when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood pressure may be high, and the patient may have signs of malnutrition. A urinalysis may reveal large amounts of protein and the presence of fat in the urine. The disorder can be screened for during pregnancy by finding elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein on a routine sampling of amniotic fluid. Genetic tests should be used to confirm the diagnosis if the screening test is positive.
Treatment
Early and aggressive treatment is required to control the disorder. Diuretic medications help rid the body of excess fluid. ACE inhibitor medications and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used to slow the spilling of protein in the urine. Antibiotics may be needed to control infections. Dietary modifications may include the restriction of sodium and use of dietary supplements. Fluids may be restricted to help control swelling. Removal of the kidneys, dialysis and kidney transplant may be recommended.
Prognosis
Congenital nephrotic syndrome may be successfully controlled in some cases with early and aggressive treatment, including early kidney transplantation, but many cases are fatal within the first year."
Constipation,"What is constipation?
Constipation is when a child has very hard stools, and has fewer bowel movements than he or she normally does. It is a very common GI (gastrointestinal) problem.
Signs that a child has constipation include:
Having fewer bowel movements than normal. Constipation is often defined as having fewer than 3 bowel movements a week. The number of bowel movements may be different for each child. But a change in what is normal for your child may mean there is a problem.
Passing stool that is hard and sometimes large
Having bowel movements that are difficult or painful to push out
What causes constipation?
Stool gets hard and dry when the large intestine (colon) takes in (absorbs) too much water.
Normally, as food moves through the colon, the colon absorbs water while it makes stool. Muscle movements (contractions) push the stool toward the rectum. When the stool gets to the rectum, most of the water has been soaked up. The stool is now solid.
If your child has constipation, the colon's muscle movements are too slow. This makes the stool move through the colon too slowly. The colon absorbs too much water. The stool gets very hard and dry.
Once a child becomes constipated, the problem can quickly get worse. Hard, dry stools can be painful to push out. So the child may stop using the bathroom because it hurts. Over time, the colon will not be able to sense that stool is there.
There are many reasons why a child may become constipated. Some common diet and lifestyle causes include:
Diet
Eating too many foods that are high in fat and low in fiber. These include fast foods, junk foods, and soft drinks.
Not drinking enough water and other fluids
Having a change in diet. This includes when babies change from breastmilk to formula, or when they start eating solid foods.
Lack of exercise
Children who watch a lot of TV and play video games don’t get enough exercise. Exercise helps move digested food through the intestines.
Emotional issues
Not wanting to use public bathrooms. Children may then hold in their bowel movements, causing constipation.
Going through toilet training. This can be a difficult time for many toddlers.
Having power struggles with parents. Toddlers may hold in their bowel movements on purpose.
Feeling stressed because of school, friends, or family
Busy children
Some children don’t pay attention to signals that their body gives them to have a bowel movement. This can happen when children are too busy playing. They forget to go to the bathroom.
Constipation can also be a problem when starting a new school year. Children can’t go to the bathroom whenever they feel the need. They have to change their bowel routine.
Underlying physical problem
 In rare cases, constipation can be caused by a larger physical problem. These physical issues can include:
Problems of the intestinal tract, rectum, or anus
Nervous system problems, such as cerebral palsy
Endocrine problems, such as hypothyroidism
Certain medicines, such as iron supplements, some antidepressants, and narcotics such as codeine
What are the symptoms of constipation?
Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each child. They may include:
Not having a bowel movement for a few days
Passing hard, dry stools
Having belly (abdominal) bloating, cramps, or pain
Not feeling hungry
Showing signs of trying to hold stool in, such as clenching teeth, crossing legs, squeezing buttocks together, turning red in the face
Small liquid or soft stool marks on a child's underwear
The symptoms of constipation can be like other health conditions. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is constipation diagnosed?
The healthcare provider will ask about your child’s symptoms and health history. He or she will give your child a physical exam. Depending on how old your child is, you might be asked questions such as:
How old was your baby when he or she had their first stool?
How often does your child have a bowel movement?
Does your child complain of pain when having a bowel movement?
Have you been trying to toilet train your toddler lately?
What foods does your child eat?
Have there been any stressful events in your child's life lately?
How often does your child poop in his or her pants?
Your child’s provider may also want to do some tests to see if there are any problems. These tests may include:
Digital rectal examination (DRE). Your child’s provider puts a gloved, greased (lubricated) finger into your child’s rectum. The provider will feel for anything abnormal.
Abdominal X-ray. This test checks how much stool is in the large intestine.
Barium enema. This is an X-ray exam of the rectum, the large intestine, and the lower part of the small intestine. Your child will be given a metallic fluid called barium. Barium coats the organs so they can be seen on an X-ray. The barium is put into a tube and inserted into your child’s rectum as an enema. An X-ray of the belly will show if your child has any narrowed areas (strictures), blockages (obstructions), or other problems.
Anorectal manometry. This test checks the strength of the muscles in the anus and the nerve reflexes. It also checks your child’s ability to sense that the rectum is full (rectal distension) and a bowel movement is needed. And it looks at how well the muscles work together during a bowel movement.
Rectal biopsy. This test takes a sample of the cells in the rectum. They are checked under a microscope for any problems.
Sigmoidoscopy. This test checks the inside of part of the large intestine. It helps to find out what is causing diarrhea, belly pain, constipation, abnormal growths, and bleeding. A short, flexible, lighted tube (sigmoidoscope) is put into your child’s intestine through the rectum. This tube blows air into the intestine to make it swell. This makes it easier to see inside.
Colorectal transit study. This test shows how well food moves through your child’s colon. The child swallows pills (capsules) filled with small markers that can be seen on an X-ray. The child eats a high-fiber diet for the next few days. X-rays will be taken 3 to 7 days after your child takes the pills. The X-rays will show how the pills moved through the colon.
Colonoscopy. This test looks at the full length of the large intestine. It can help check for abnormal growths, red or swollen tissue, sores (ulcers), and bleeding. The test uses a long, flexible, lighted tube (colonoscope). The tube is put into your child’s rectum up into the colon. This tube lets the provider see the lining of the colon and take out a tissue sample (biopsy) to test it. The provider may also be able to treat some problems that are found.
Lab testing. Several tests may be done. These include tests to check for issues such as celiac disease, urinary tract infection, thyroid  problems, metabolic problems, and blood lead level.
How is constipation treated?
Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
Treatment may include diet and lifestyle changes, such as:
Diet changes
Often making changes in your child's diet will help constipation. Help your child to eat more fiber by:
Adding more fruits and vegetables
Adding more whole-grain cereals and breads. Check the nutrition labels on food packages for foods that have more fiber.
  Foods
Moderate fiber
High fiber
Bread
Whole-wheat bread, granola bread, wheat bran muffins, whole-grain waffles, popcorn
  Cereal
Bran cereals, shredded wheat, oatmeal, granola, oat bran
100% bran cereal
Vegetables
Beets, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, corn, green beans, green peas, acorn and butternut squash, spinach, potato with skin, avocado
  Fruits
Apples with peel, dates, papayas, mangoes, nectarines, oranges, pears, kiwis, strawberries, applesauce, raspberries, blackberries, raisins
Cooked prunes, dried figs
Meat substitutes
Peanut butter, nuts
Baked beans, black-eyed peas, garbanzo beans, lima beans, pinto beans, kidney beans, chili with beans, trail mix
Other diet changes that may help include:
Having your child drink more fluids, especially water
Limiting fast foods and junk foods that are often high in fats. Offer more well-balanced meals and snacks instead.
Limiting drinks with caffeine, such as soda and tea
Limiting whole milk as directed by your child’s healthcare provider
It’s also a good idea to have your child eat meals on a regular schedule. Eating a meal will often cause a bowel movement within 30 to 60 minutes. Serve breakfast early. This will give your child time to have a bowel movement at home before rushing off to school.
Get more exercise
Having your child get more exercise can also help with constipation. Exercise helps with digestion. It helps the normal movements the intestines make to push food forward as it is digested. People who don’t move around much are often constipated. Have your child go outside and play rather than watch TV or do other indoor activities.
Good bowel habits
Try to get your child into a regular toilet habit. Have your child sit on the toilet at least twice a day for at least 10 minutes. Try to do this just after a meal. Be sure to make this a pleasant time. Don’t get mad at your child for not having a bowel movement. Use a reward system to make it fun. Give stickers or other small treats. Or make posters that show your child's progress.
In some cases these changes may not help. Or your child’s healthcare provider may detect another problem. If so, the provider may recommend using laxatives, stool softeners, or an enema. These products should only be used if recommended by your child's provider. Do not use them without talking with your child's provider first.
What are the complications of constipation?
Hard stools can irritate or tear the lining of the anus (anal fissures). This makes it painful to have a bowel movement. Your child may avoid having a bowel movement because it hurts. This can make constipation get worse.
Can constipation be prevented?
Constipation can be prevented by figuring out the times when it may occur, and making proper changes.
For instance, when babies start to eat solid food, constipation can result. This is because they don’t have enough fiber in their new diet. You can add fiber to your  baby’s diet by giving pureed vegetables and fruits. Or try whole-wheat or multigrain cereals.
Constipation can also happen during toilet training. Children who do not like using a regular toilet may hold in their stool. This causes constipation.
All children should get the right amount of fiber and fluids. Other preventative measures include  making sure your child has:
Regular access to a bathroom
Enough time to use the toilet
Regular physical exercise
The same changes that can help treat constipation may also help to stop it from happening.
Living with constipation
Constipation can be either short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). Children with intestinal diseases may have chronic constipation problems. But in most cases, constipation is a short-term condition.If your child has chronic constipation, work with his or her healthcare provider. Together you can create a care plan that is right for your child.
When should I call my child's healthcare provider?
Call your child's healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns about your child's bowel habits or patterns. Talk with your child's provider if your child:
Is constipated for more than 2 weeks
Can’t do normal activities because of constipation
Can’t get a stool out with normal pushing
Has liquid or soft stool leaking out of the anus
Has small, painful tears in the skin around the anus (anal fissures)
Has red, swollen veins (hemorrhoids) in the rectum
Has belly pain, fever, or vomiting
Key points about constipation
Constipation is when a child has very hard stools, and has fewer bowel movements than they normally do.
Constipation can be caused by a child’s diet, lack of exercise, or emotional issues.
Once a child becomes constipated, the problem can quickly get worse.
Making diet and lifestyle changes can help treat and help prevent constipation.
Never give your child an enema, laxative, or stool softener unless the healthcare provider recommends this.
Next steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Craniosynostosis,"What is deformational plagiocephaly?
Deformational, or positional, plagiocephaly is when a baby develops a flat spot on one side of the head or the whole back of the head. It happens when a baby sleeps in the same position most of the time or because of problems with the neck muscles that result in a head-turning preference. Deformational plagiocephaly is also sometimes called “flat head syndrome.”
Deformational plagiocephaly is different from craniosynostosis. Craniosynostosis is when a baby’s skull bones fuse together before they are supposed to. In deformational plagiocephaly, there is no fusion of the skull bones.
What causes deformational plagiocephaly?
When a baby’s head stays in one position for long periods of time, the skull flattens. Sometimes a baby is born with this flattening because of a tight space in the uterus. This risk is often increased if there are twins or multiples. Other things that may lead to deformational plagiocephaly include:
Muscular torticollis. Muscular torticollis is a problem that is present at birth (congenital). One or more of the neck muscles is very tight. This tightness keeps the baby’s head in the same position.
Prematurity. The skull bones of premature babies are softer. And many premature babies spend a lot of time in the hospital on respirators with their heads in the same position.
Back sleeping. Babies who sleep on their backs or in car seats without changing positions for long periods of time can develop flat heads. However, the safest way for babies to sleep is on their back. This reduces the risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).
Who is at risk for deformational plagiocephaly?
Babies may be more likely to have this condition if they are:
A first-born child
Male
Born with the help of instruments. These include forceps and vacuum extraction.
What are the symptoms of deformational plagiocephaly?
This problem may not be noticeable or present at birth. It may develop during the first few months of life. A flat spot may appear on one side of the head or the whole back of the head as the baby grows.
How is deformational plagiocephaly diagnosed?
Your baby’s health care provider will check your baby’s head from all positions. He or she will feel your child’s head, particularly along the suture lines. The provider will also measure your baby’s head to figure out how serious the condition is.
How is deformational plagiocephaly treated?
Treatment will depend on your baby’s symptoms, age and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is. Treatment may include:
Changing your baby’s sleep position by turning the head to the opposite side (repositioning therapy)
Maximizing tummy time when your baby is awake and minimizing time in infant devices (such as bouncers, swings and car seats)
Receiving physical therapy to promote symmetric development of trunk and neck muscles
If the problem is moderate to severe and/or the plagiocephaly does not improve much by the time your baby has reached the age of 6 months, your baby’s health care provider may recommend a cranial orthotic helmet. Helmets usually have an outer hard shell and a foam lining. The helmets are custom made to direct your baby’s remaining head growth into the areas that need the most correction. Helmets are very effective for positional plagiocephaly when fitted and worn properly. The duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the flattening and the age at the start of treatment and will be monitored by an orthotist. Helmets must be prescribed by a health care provider who has experience with this treatment.
What are the complications of deformational plagiocephaly?
As babies grow and develop, they will move and reposition themselves. This removes the pressure that may have caused the condition. But if the flat spot is moderate to severe, it may not get better on its own. If treatment is not started early enough, your child’s head may continue to be uneven.
Can deformational plagiocephaly be prevented?
This condition has increased since the “Back to Sleep” campaign, which was started to decrease deaths from SIDS and has been very successful. It is important that young babies not be placed on their belly to sleep. This is because they cannot roll over and move themselves. These tips can help prevent a flat head:
Let your baby have tummy time while he or she is awake and you are watching.
Lessen the time your baby spends in bouncers, swings and car seats.
Hold your baby, giving him or her time to be upright.
When should I call my child’s health care provider?
If you notice that your baby’s head is misshapen, or you are worried about a flat spot, have your baby checked by his or her health care provider.
Key Points About Deformational Plagiocephaly
Deformational plagiocephaly is when a baby develops a lasting flat spot on one side of the head or the back of the head.
The first steps in treating deformational plagiocephaly are changing your baby’s head position (repositioning), maximizing tummy time and minimizing time in infant devices.
Some babies may need to wear a cranial orthotic helmet.
Many cases will improve with conservative treatment alone, provided attention is directed early to the problem.
Next Steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis and any new medicines, treatments or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are.
Ask if your child’s condition can be treated in other ways.
Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.
Know what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.
If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Croup,"What is croup?
Croup is a disease that causes swelling in the airways and problems breathing. Children with croup often have a high-pitched “creaking” or whistling sound when breathing in. This is called stridor.
What causes croup?
Croup is most commonly caused by a virus. It is sometimes, but rarely, caused by bacteria, allergies, or reflux from the stomach. Viruses that are known to cause croup are:
Parainfluenza virus
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)
Influenza virus
Adenovirus
Enteroviruses
Croup is spread through direct contact with a person, or fluids from another person who has the disease. The infection starts in the nose and throat and moves into the lungs. Swelling affects the area around the voice box (larynx) and into the windpipe (trachea).
Younger children are more affected by croup because their airways are smaller. Therefore, a small amount of swelling can make it really hard for a child to breathe.
Facts about croup
Croup is most commonly seen in children 3 months old to 5 years.
The peak time for croup to occur is 2 years old.
Croup is seen more often in the winter.
What are the symptoms of croup
Symptoms of croup are not always the same. As the disease moves from the nose to the lungs, the symptoms can change. Common symptoms of croup are:
A runny nose, a stuffy nose, and slight cough
A cough that turns into a ""seal's bark""
Laryngitis (losing his or her voice)
Fever
Stridor
Symptoms are often worse at night and wake the child from sleep. Symptoms also seem to improve in the morning but worsen as the day goes on. Most children improve in three to seven days. The symptoms of croup can be mistaken for other conditions and medical problems. Always see your child's provider for a diagnosis.
How is croup diagnosed?
Your child’s provider will do a complete medical history and physical examination. Other tests may be needed, including:
Neck and chest X-rays
Blood tests
Pulse oximetry. An oximeter is a small device that measures the amount of oxygen in the blood.
Treatment for croup
Treatment for croup depends on:
Your child's age, overall health, and medical history
How sick your child is
How well your child does with medications, procedures, or therapies
How long the disease is expected to last
Your opinion or wishes
In severe cases of croup, or if your child is not breathing well, your child may need to go to the hospital. This is sometimes hard to tell because the disease changes. Your child may seem better at one moment, and then get worse the next. Your child's provider may also order the following medications to help with the symptoms of croup:
Inhaled medications
Injected medications
Oral medications (taken by mouth)
Home treatments may include:
Using a cool mist humidifier
Taking the child outside into cool, moist, night air
Drinking lots of fluids
Treating a fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, as instructed by your child's provider (Do NOT give a child aspirin as it can cause a condition called Reye syndrome)
Keeping your child as quiet and calm as possible to make it easier to breathe"
Cystic fibrosis (CF),"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Cystic fibrosis is an inherited disease characterized by an abnormality in the glands that produce sweat and mucus.
Cystic fibrosis affects various organ systems in children and young adults, including the respiratory system, digestive system and reproductive system.
Due to improved treatments, people with cystic fibrosis, on average, live into their mid to late 30s."
Cystic fibrosis liver disease,"What is cystic fibrosis liver disease?
Liver disease associated with cystic fibrosis (CF) has been increasingly diagnosed during recent years, most likely due to the combined effect of systematic hepatic assessment and reduced death from extrahepatic causes of CF patients. Although the natural history of CF-associated liver disease suggests a benign and protracted course in most cases, it is considered a major complication of CF, which may limit survival and quality of life."
Cystic hygroma,"What is a cystic hygroma?
A cystic hygroma — or lymphangioma — is a birth defect that appears as a sac-like structure with a thin wall that most commonly occurs in the head and neck area of an infant. As the baby grows in the womb, it can develop from pieces of material that carries fluid and white blood cells. Such material is called embryonic lymphatic tissue. After birth, a cystic hygroma usually looks like a soft bulge under the skin. The cyst can't be seen until after birth and sometimes is not noticed until the person is older.
Symptoms
A common symptom is a neck mass found at birth or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection. 
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by physical examination, possibly including:
Chest X-ray
Ultrasound
CT scan 
Treatment
Treatment involves surgical removal of the abnormal tissue whenever possible. However, cystic hygromas can often invade other parts of the neck, making this impossible.
Other treatments have been attempted with only limited success, including:
Chemotherapy medications
Injection of sclerosing medications
Radiation therapy
Steroids"
Delayed puberty,"What is Delayed Puberty?
Delayed puberty is a condition where the sexual development starts later than usual, typically later than 14 years of age. Medical conditions, including diabetes, cystic fibrosis or kidney disease, can cause delayed puberty, but sometimes no cause can be identified. Disorders of the thyroid or pituitary glands may cause delayed puberty. Malnutrition can also delay puberty.
Symptoms
No breast development in girls by age 13
No menstruation for five or more years after the first appearance of breast tissue
No testicles development by age 14 in boys
Incompletely developed male organs by five years after the first start to develop
Diagnosis
Complete physical exam and medical history
Blood tests to determine hormone levels
X-rays of the hand to determine bone age
When to Call for Help
If your child exhibits no signs or few signs of sexual development by age 13 for girls, or by age 14 for boys, see a doctor.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the individual case and the specific cause. For example, if insufficient hormones are the cause, delayed puberty can be treated by the use of supplemental hormones."
Depression,"What is Depression?
Depression can strike a child at any age. A mood disorder, depression is characterized by a persistent sad or empty feeling, irritability, and a loss of interest in everyday activities. Unlike normal sadness or grieving, most bouts of depression last for weeks, months, or even years. A smaller number of children and adolescent suffer from bipolar disorder-bouts of depression interspersed with periods of elevated (manic) mood (bipolar disorder).
Although depression is usually not considered life-threatening, it can lead to thoughts of and attempts at suicide.
Symptoms
Persistent feelings of sadness, apathy, or hopelessness lasting more than two weeks.
Diminished interest in most daily activities, particularly pleasurable ones.
Decreased appetite and subsequent weight loss; increased appetite and weight gain.
Lack of sleep (insomnia), frequent awakening throughout the night, or conversely, an increased need for sleep.
Anxiety; diminished ability to think or concentrate.
Diagnosis
Because there are no reliable laboratory tests to diagnose depression, physical examination and psychological evaluation are essential.
Expression of either of the first two symptoms of depression (see Symptoms box), in conjunction with other symptoms, for a period of two or more consecutive weeks.
A positive family history of depression or a prior depressive episode helps establish the diagnosis.
Treatment
Psychotherapy is as effective as drug treatment in mild cases. Psychotherapy may also be used in conjunction with drug therapy.
Antidepressant medications, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are mainstays of treatment.
Exposure to bright light, known as light therapy, may be effective, particularly when depression is related to seasonal changes (seasonal affective disorder).
In secondary depression, the underlying cause is addressed, although antidepressant therapy may also be prescribed."
Dermatomyositis,"What is dermatomyositis?
Dermatomyositis is a rare disease that causes muscle inflammation and skin rash. It’s one of a group of muscle diseases that cause muscle inflammation and swelling. It's different from other muscle diseases because it also causes skin problems. Dermatoyositis is the term used to describe both muscle and skin symptoms.
It can occur at any age, but it most often affects adults ages 50 to 70. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with the disease. Some people with the disease also have a connective tissue disorder, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.
What causes dermatomyositis?
The exact cause is not known, but possible causes include:
Abnormal genes you are born with
Cancer, especially in older people
Autoimmune disease, a type of illness that causes the body’s immune system to attack its own tissues
An infection, medication, or another exposure in your environment that triggers the disease
What are the symptoms of dermatomyositis?
The symptoms are caused by swelling and inflammation in the blood vessels that supply your skin and muscles, and can include:
Red or purple rash on sun-exposed areas that may be painful or itchy
Red or purple swelling of the upper eyelids (heliotrope)
Red or purple spots on the knuckles, elbows, knees, and toes (Gottron's papules)
Joints that feel stuff and turn pale and painful in cold conditions and feel better when warmed (Raynaud's phenomenon)
Scaly, rough, dry skin, which can lead to hair thinning
Swollen, red areas around the fingernails
Hard lumps under the skin caused by calcium deposits (calcinosis)
Muscle weakness in the neck, hip, back, and shoulders
Trouble swallowing and voice changes
Tiredness, fever, and weight loss
Muscle aches
Trouble rising from a chair or getting out of bed due to muscle weakness
Sometimes the muscle weakness also spreads to the heart, GI tract, and lungs. This can cause breathing trouble and coughing. Adults may have a low-grade fever, along with lung inflammation and sensitivity to light.
How is dermatomyositis diagnosed?
The process starts with a person’s medical history and a physical exam. The health care provider will look for an underlying disease, such as cancer. Tests may also be done, such as:
Blood tests. These are done to look for signs of muscle inflammation. They also check for abnormal proteins that form in autoimmune disease. The most common blood tests include muscle enzyme creatine kinase and the antinuclear antibody.
Electromyelogram (EMG). This may be done to find abnormal electrical activity in affected muscles.
MRI. This test uses large magnets and a computer to look for inflammation in the body.
Skin or muscle biopsy. Tiny pieces of tissue are taken to be checked with a microscope.
How is dermatomyositis treated?
Treatment will depend on your symptoms, your age, and your general health. There's no cure for the condition, but the symptoms can be managed. You may need more than one kind of treatment. And your treatment may need to be changed over time. Treatments include:
Physical therapy. Special exercises help to stretch and strengthen the muscles. Orthotics or assistive devices may be used.
Skin treatment. You may need to avoid sun exposure and wear sunscreen to help prevent skin rashes. Your health care provider can treat itchy skin rashes with antihistamine drugs or with anti-inflammatory steroid creams that are applied to the skin.
Anti-inflammatory medications. These are steroid drugs, or corticosteroids. They ease inflammation in the body. They may be given by mouth or through an IV.
Immunosuppressive drugs. These are drugs that block or slow down your body's immune system. These include the drugs azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine A, cyclophosphamide, and tacrolimus.
Immunoglobulin. If you have not responded to other treatments, these drugs may be given. They are donated blood products that may boost your body's immune system. They are put directly into your bloodstream through an IV.
Surgery. Surgery may be done to remove the calcium deposits (calcinosis) under the skin if they become painful or infected.
Talk with your health care providers about the risks, benefits, and possible side effects of all medications.
Dermatomyositis in Children
What is dermatomyositis?
Childhood dermatomyositis describes a group of muscle diseases characterized by chronic muscle inflammation followed by progressive muscle weakness.
Symptoms
Skin rash (patchy and bluish/purple or red) that precedes or accompanies muscle weakness
Swelling in the affected area
Calcium deposits
Diagnosis
Careful clinical evaluation is required to determine the cause of the symptoms.
Treatment
There is no cure for dermatomyositis, but you can treat the symptoms with medication, physical therapy, exercise, heat therapy and rest. Medications include corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs and topical ointments.
What are the complications of dermatomyositis?
Possible complications for some people with dermatomyositis include lung disease, heart disease, or cancer. These can make treatment more difficult.
Living with dermatomyositis
If you have dermatomyositis, you may need to be treated for the rest of your life. It's important to learn as much as you can about the disease. Work closely with your health care provider. Researchers are studying causes and treatments for the condition. Early diagnosis and treatment for the disease may improve over time.
When should I call my health care provider?
If your symptoms get worse or you notice new symptoms, notify your health care provider.
Key points
Dermatomyositis is a rare disease that causes muscle weakness and skin rash.
Symptoms include a red or purple rash on sun exposed skin and eyelids, calcium deposits under the skin, muscle weakness, and trouble talking or swallowing.
There is no cure, but treatment is done to reduce the symptoms.
Complications include lung disease, heart disease, and cancer.

Diabetes insipidus,"What is diabetes insipidus?
Diabetes insipidus (DI), also called water diabetes, is a condition marked by increased thirst and urination. It is not to be confused with the more common type of diabetes, diabetes mellitus (sugar diabetes). Four underlying conditions can lead to DI.
Central DI is the most common type and is caused by destruction of part of the pituitary gland that produces vasopressin, which regulates water balance and urine output from the kidneys. In infants and children, this is often an inherited condition. Other causes include tumors, infections and head injury.
Nephrogenic DI occurs when the pituitary produces enough vasopressin but the kidneys fail to recognize it because of an inherited or acquired kidney disease.
Maintaining proper water balance by drinking enough fluids is critical for children with DI, as they tend to lose a lot of water with frequent urination, which can lead to life-threatening dehydration. However, drinking too much water is also dangerous, as it may lead to a rare condition called water intoxication.
Symptoms
Increased thirst
Frequent urination
Increased urine volume
Pale or colorless, watery urine
Night-time urination (nocturia)
Fatigue due to frequent nighttime urination and interrupted sleep
Diagnosis
Definitive diagnosis is most often made with:
Water-deprivation test: The child must abstain from drinking fluids for a period of time, after which their urine is tested to determine the concentration of particles.
Vasopressin test: The body’s reaction to vasopressin after the hormone is injected in the body
Hypertonic saline infusion test: A mixture of water and salt is given intravenously and then the patient’s blood is tested for particle concentration and vasopressin levels.
When to Call for Help
If you see any of the above symptoms in your child or teen, call your pediatrician. Increased urination and odorless, pale urine should always be red flags as they may signal water imbalance.
Children with DI are also at an increased risk for dehydration if they don’t replenish the loss of water, so they need to be observed for signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth, sluggishness, muscle weakness, dizziness, few or no tears when crying, rapid heart beat, fever, lack of sweating and extreme thirst.
Treatment
Medications that deliver synthetic vasopressin are the therapy for central DI. For nephrogenic DI, water pills (diuretics) are used."
Diabetes mellitus,"What is type 1 diabetes in children?
Diabetes is a condition in which the body can't make enough insulin, or can't use insulin normally. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder. The body's immune system damages the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Insulin is a hormone. It helps sugar (glucose) in the blood get into cells of the body to be used as fuel. When glucose can’t enter the cells, it builds up in the blood. This is called high blood sugar (hyperglycemia). High blood sugar can cause problems all over the body. It can damage blood vessels and nerves. It can harm the eyes, kidneys, and heart. It can also cause symptoms such as tiredness.
Type 1 diabetes is a long-term (chronic) condition. It may start at any age. Insulin from the pancreas must be replaced with insulin injections or an insulin pump.
There are two forms of type 1 diabetes:
Immune-mediated diabetes. This is an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system damages the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. This is the most common kind of type 1 diabetes.
Idiopathic type 1. This refers to rare forms of the disease with no known cause.
What causes type 1 diabetes in a child?
The cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. Researchers think some people inherit a gene than can cause type 1 diabetes if a trigger such as a virus occurs.
Which children are at risk for type 1 diabetes?
A child is more at risk for type 1 diabetes if he or she has any of these risk factors:
A family member with the condition
Caucasian race
Being from Finland or Sardinia
Is age 4 to 6, or 10 to 14
What are the symptoms of type 1 diabetes in a child?
Type 1 diabetes often appears suddenly. In children, type 1 diabetes symptoms may be like flu symptoms. Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each child. They can include:
High levels of glucose in the blood and urine when tested
Unusual thirst
Dehydration
Frequent urination (a baby may need more diaper changes, or a toilet-trained child may start wetting his or her pants)
Extreme hunger but weight loss
Loss of appetite in younger children
Blurred vision
Nausea and vomiting
Belly (abdominal) pain
Weakness and fatigue
Irritability and mood changes
Serious diaper rash that does get better with treatment
Fruity breath and fast breathing
Yeast infection in girls
The symptoms of type 1 diabetes can be like other health conditions. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is type 1 diabetes diagnosed in a child?
The healthcare provider will ask about your child’s symptoms and health history. He or she may also ask about your family’s health history. He or she will give your child a physical exam. Your child may also have blood tests, such as:
Fasting plasma glucose. The blood is tested after at least 8 hours of not eating.
Random plasma glucose. The blood is tested when there are symptoms of increased thirst, urination, and hunger.
How is type 1 diabetes treated in a child?
Children with type 1 diabetes must have daily injections of insulin to keep the blood glucose level within normal ranges. Insulin is given either by injection or insulin pump. Your child’s healthcare provider will show you how to give your child insulin with either method.
Treatment will also include:
Eating the right foods to manage blood glucose levels. This includes timing meals and counting carbohydrates.
Exercise, to lower blood sugar
Regular blood testing to check blood-glucose levels
Regular urine testing to check ketone levels
What are the possible complications of type 1 diabetes in a child?
Type 1 diabetes can cause:
Ketoacidosis. This is when blood sugar levels are very high and the body starts making ketones. This is a very serious condition that needs to be treated right away in the hospital, sometimes in the intensive care unit. If your child is not treated right away, they are at risk for diabetic coma. A child with a diabetic coma loses consciousness because of brain swelling. The brain swells because of the very high blood sugar levels.
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This is also sometimes called an insulin reaction. This occurs when blood glucose drops too low.
Your child’s healthcare provider will tell you how to avoid these problems.
Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels. Balancing insulin, diet, and activity can help keep blood sugar levels in the target range and help prevent complications such as:
Eye problems
Kidney disease
Nerve damage
Tooth and gum problems
Skin and foot problems
Heart and blood vessel disease
How can I help my child live with type 1 diabetes?
A type 1 diabetes diagnosis can be stressful for a child and his or her family. A younger child may not understand all the life changes, such as glucose monitoring and insulin injections. A child may feel:
As if he or she is being punished
Guilty
Fearful of death
Angry toward the parent
Parents can help their child by treating him or her as a normal child with diabetes management as just one aspect of their daily life.
Many areas have diabetes camps, support groups, and other organizations for children with type 1 diabetes and their families. Talk with your child’s healthcare provider for more information.
When should I call my child's healthcare provider?
Call your child's healthcare team if you need help. Also call the healthcare team if your child:
Has new symptoms
Often has high blood glucose levels
Often has hypoglycemia
Key points about type 1 diabetes in children
Type 1 diabetes is a long-term (chronic) condition. It may start at any age. Only 5% of people with diabetes have type 1.
Type 1 diabetes is a condition in which blood glucose levels are abnormally high.
It is most frequently caused by an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immune system destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin.
Children with type 1 diabetes must have daily injections of insulin to keep the blood glucose level within normal ranges.
Without insulin, blood glucose levels continue to rise and death will occur.
With the administration of insulin, and other management activities, children with type 1 diabetes can lead active, healthy lives.

Diarrhea,"What is diarrhea?
Diarrhea is when stools (bowel movements) are loose and watery. Your child may also need to go to the bathroom more often.
Diarrhea is a common problem. It may last 1 or 2 days and go away on its own. If diarrhea lasts more than 2 days, your child may have a more serious problem.
Diarrhea may be either:
Short-term (acute). Diarrhea that lasts 1 or 2 days and goes away. This may be caused by food or water that was contaminated by bacteria (bacterial infection). Or it may happen if your child gets sick from a virus.
Long-term (chronic). Diarrhea that lasts for a few weeks. This may be caused by another health problem such as irritable bowel syndrome. It can also be caused by an intestinal disease. This includes ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, or celiac disease. Giardia may also cause chronic diarrhea.
What causes diarrhea?
Diarrhea may be caused by many things, including:
Bacterial infection
Viral infection
Trouble digesting certain things (food intolerance)
An immune system response to certain foods (food allergy)
Parasites that enter the body through food or water
Reaction to medicines
An intestinal disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease
A problem with how the stomach and bowels work (functional bowel disorder), such as irritable bowel syndrome
Surgery on the stomach or gallbladder
Children who visit some foreign countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea. This is caused by having food or water that is not safe because of bacteria, viruses, or parasites.
Severe diarrhea may mean a child has a serious disease. Talk with your child's healthcare provider if symptoms don’t go away. Also talk with the provider if symptoms stop your child from doing daily activities. It may be hard to find out what is causing your child’s diarrhea. 
What are the symptoms of diarrhea?
Symptoms can occur a bit differently in each child. They can include:
Cramping
Belly (abdominal) pain
Swelling (bloating)
Upset stomach (nausea)
Urgent need to use the bathroom
Fever
Bloody stools
Loss of body fluids (dehydration)
Incontinence
The symptoms of diarrhea may look like other health problems. Severe diarrhea may be a sign of a serious disease. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is diarrhea diagnosed?
The healthcare provider will ask about your child’s symptoms and health history. He or she will give your child a physical exam. Your child may have lab tests to check blood and urine.
Other tests may include:
A stool culture to check for abnormal bacteria or parasites in your child’s digestive tract. A small stool sample is taken and sent to a lab.
A stool evaluation to check the stool for blood or fat
Blood tests to rule out certain diseases
Imaging tests to rule out structural problems
Tests to check for food intolerance or allergies
A sigmoidoscopy. This test lets the healthcare provider check the inside of part of your child’s large intestine. It helps to tell what is causing diarrhea, stomach pain, constipation, abnormal growths, and bleeding. It uses a short, flexible, lighted tube (sigmoidoscope). The tube is put into your child’s intestine through the rectum. This tube blows air into the intestine to make it swell. This makes it easier to see inside.
How is diarrhea treated?
Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
Dehydration is the major concern with diarrhea. In most cases, treatment includes replacing lost fluids. Antibiotics may be prescribed when bacterial infections are the cause.
Children should drink lots of fluids. This helps replace the lost body fluids. If your child is dehydrated, be sure to:
Offer drinks called glucose-electrolyte solutions. These fluids have the right balance of water, sugar, and salts. Some are available as popsicles.
Avoid juice or soda. They may make diarrhea worse.
Not give plain water to your baby
Not give too much plain water to kids of any age. It can be dangerous.
Keep breastfeeding your baby. Breastfed babies often have less diarrhea.
Keep feeding your baby formula, if you were already doing so
What are the complications of diarrhea?
The greatest complication of diarrhea is dehydration. This is more likely with young children and those with a weakened immune system. Dehydration can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild dehydration is the loss of fluid. Moderate or severe dehydration puts stress on the heart and lungs. In the worst cases it can lead to shock, which is life-threatening.
What can I do to prevent diarrhea?
Proper handwashing can reduce the spread of bacteria that may cause diarrhea.
A rotavirus vaccine can prevent diarrhea caused by rotaviruses. Ask your child's healthcare provider which vaccines are right for your child.
When you travel, make sure anything your child eats and drinks is safe. This is even more important if you travel to developing countries.
Travel safety tips for drinking and eating include:
Not drinking tap water or using it to brush teeth
Not using ice made from tap water
Not drinking unpasteurized milk (milk that has not gone through a process to kill certain bacteria)
Not eating raw fruits and vegetables unless you wash and peel them yourself
Not eating raw or undercooked meat or fish
Not eating food from street vendors or food trucks
Talk with your child's healthcare provider before traveling.
When should I call my child's healthcare provider?
Call your child's provider if your child is less than 6 months old or has any of the following symptoms:
Belly pain
Blood in the stool
Frequent vomiting
Doesn’t want to drink liquids
High fever
Dry, sticky mouth
Weight loss
Urinates less frequently (wets fewer than 6 diapers per day)
Frequent diarrhea
Extreme thirst
No tears when crying
Sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on baby’s head
Key points about diarrhea
Diarrhea is loose, watery stool. Your child may also have to go to the bathroom more often.
It may be caused by many things, including bacterial infection or viral infection.

Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Disruptive behavior disorders,"What are disruptive behavior disorders (conduct and oppositional)?
Disruptive behavior disorders constitute behaviors that consistently “break the rules,” disrupt the lives of those around them and defy authority. While oppositional behavior is common in very young children and teens, in extreme cases it can require professional assessment and intervention.
Attention-Deficit / Hyperactivity Disorder
Conduct Disorder
Oppositional Defiant Disorder
Symptoms
Disruptive behavior can be classified into two distinct categories. In oppositional defiant disorder, the rules broken are chiefly those within the family and school: regular temper tantrums, failure to accept responsibility for bad behavior and frequent defiance of parents and teachers. In conduct disorders, aggressive behaviors threaten others, like people and animals. Bullying, lying, stealing and truancy may also be identified.
Diagnosis
Diagnosing disruptive behavior disorders requires a professional, skilled evaluation.
Treatment
Generally, treatment involves a combination of therapies to teach children and teens how to control and express feelings appropriately, including parent training and family therapy."
Empyema,"What is empyema?
Empyema is a collection of pus in the cavity between the lung and the membrane that surrounds it (pleural space). Caused by an infection that spreads from the lung and leads to an accumulation of pus in the pleural space, the infected fluid can build up to a quantity of a pint or more, which puts pressure on the lungs, causing shortness of breath and pain. Risk factors include recent lung conditions like bacterial pneumonia, lung abscess, thoracic surgery, trauma or injury to the chest. 
Symptoms
Dry cough 
Fever and chills 
Excessive sweating, especially night sweats 
General discomfort, uneasiness or ill feeling (malaise) 
Unintentional weight loss 
Chest pain, which worsens on deep inhalation (inspiration) 
Diagnosis
The health care provider may note abnormal findings, such as decreased breath sounds or a friction rub, when listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Tests may include: 
Chest X-ray
Thoracentesis 
Pleural fluid Gram stain and culture 
CT scan of chest 
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to cure the infection and remove the collection of pus from the lung. Antibiotics are prescribed to control the infection. A doctor will place a chest tube to completely drain the pus. A surgeon may need to perform a procedure to peel away the lining of the lung (decortication) if the lung does not expand properly. 
Prognosis
Usually, empyema does not result in permanent pulmonary damage."
Encephalitis,Encephalitis is a serious condition affecting the brain that requires prompt treatment to lower the risk of lasting complications or death.
Endocarditis,"What is endocarditis?
Endocarditis is an inflammation of the heart’s inner lining and most commonly brought about when bacteria enters the blood stream though another part of the body (most often the mouth). Risk factors for this intravascular infection include dental procedures, an abnormal or damaged heart valve and certain heart defects.
Symptoms
Mild cases of endocarditis have flu-like symptoms. Serious cases can cause:
Severe headaches
Drowsiness
Confusion
Seizures
Sudden fever
Vomiting
Diagnosis
Diagnosis can include an echocardiogram. 
Treatment
Treatment includes antibiotics and sometimes surgery.
 "
Eosinophilic esophagitis,"Eosinophilic esophagitis is an allergic condition that happens in the esophagus. The esophagus becomes inflamed and does not contract properly. It can get narrowed and develop rings or abscesses.  The symptoms happen when your immune system makes white blood cells in reaction to an allergen. The white blood cells are called eosinophils.
The condition is called eosinophilic esophagitis, or EE or EoE. It can happen at any age and is commonly seen in white males.
Causes
EoE is caused by an allergic reaction to certain foods or environmental allergens. 
Symptoms
Symptoms of EoE vary from person to person and may include:
Trouble swallowing
Chest pain or heartburn
Abdominal pain
Vomiting
Food getting stuck in the throat due to narrowing (this is a medical emergency)
Stunted growth or poor weight gain in children
Risk factors
People with atopic dermatitis, asthma, or food or environmental allergies have a much greater chance of developing EoE it. Some other conditions can cause eosinophils to increase in number in the esophagus. Your healthcare provider will need to evaluate you for these possible conditions. Family history of EoE is also a risk factor for the condition. 
Diagnosis
Your healthcare provider will take your medical history and will likely want to test you for allergies. He or she will probably request an endoscopy by a gastroenterologist, a specialist in digestive (stomach and swallowing) disorders. This is an outpatient procedure that involves passing a thin, flexible endoscope with a camera through your mouth and down your throat to look at your esophagus. The gastroenterologist will check for physical signs of inflammation and an increased number of eosinophils. To confirm the diagnosis, your gastroenterologist will likely need to take a biopsy, or tissue sample, from your esophagus.
Treatment
For treatment, you will need to work closely with an allergist and/or a gastroenterologist. They’ll help you figure out what substances or foods to avoid. No specific medicines can cure EoE, although certain medicines, such as corticosteroids and proton pump inhibitors, and eliminating specific foods—dairy, egg, wheat, soy, peanut, tree nuts, and fish—from your diet can help reduce the redness and swelling in your esophagus.
You can help manage EoE by learning what substances cause your allergic reaction and avoiding them. In many cases, the allergens come from food. It’s also important to know that reactions related to EoE might take days or weeks to develop. Keep this in mind when beginning a food elimination plan. It might take some time after avoiding a particular food to determine whether that strategy worked.
Sometimes the esophagus needs to be dilated (stretched) if it has narrowed.
Complications
The long-term complications of EoE are not clearly understood. If left untreated, symptoms will continue and damage to the esophagus causing narrowing may happen. 
Call 911
Call 911 if you have:
Food stuck in your throat
Difficulty breathing or talking
Chest pain
When to call the healthcare provider
Call your healthcare provider if you have EoE and notice any of these symptoms:
Increasing weight loss
Increase in vomiting
Increasing difficulty swallowing
Stomach pain
Living with EoE
To manage EoE it is important to work closely with your gastroenterologist. He or she can tell you when tests are needed to check on whether your EoE is getting better or worse. An allergist/immunologist and dietitian can help you manage related problems like asthma, allergic rhinitis, and food allergies. Work with your health professionals so that communication occurs between them. Some families find support groups and organizations helpful. American Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders (APFED) is an organization that helps families cope with EoE.
EoE is a life-long condition. Management includes avoiding the foods or allergens that cause the allergic reaction.It can take patience to identify and then remove allergens from your diet. However, your quality of life will improve as your management plan progresses."
Epilepsy,"What is epilepsy in children?
Epilepsy is a brain condition that causes a child to have seizures. It is one of the most common disorders of the nervous system. It affects children and adults of all races and ethnic backgrounds.
The brain consists of nerve cells that communicate with each other through electrical activity. A seizure occurs when one or more parts of the brain has a burst of abnormal electrical signals that interrupt normal brain signals. Anything that interrupts the normal connections between nerve cells in the brain can cause a seizure. This includes a high fever, high or low blood sugar, alcohol or drug withdrawal, or a brain concussion. But when a child has 2 or more seizures with no known cause, this is diagnosed as epilepsy.
There are different types of seizures. The type of seizure depends on which part and how much of the brain is affected and what happens during the seizure. The 2 main categories of epileptic seizures are focal (partial) seizure and generalized seizure.
Focal (partial) seizures
Focal seizures take place when abnormal electrical brain function occurs in one or more areas of one side of the brain. Before a focal seizure, your child may have an aura, or signs that a seizure is about to occur. This is more common with a complex focal seizure. The most common aura involves feelings, such as deja vu, impending doom, fear, or euphoria. Or your child may have visual changes, hearing abnormalities, or changes in sense of smell. The 2 types of focal seizures are:
Simple focal seizure. The symptoms depend on which area of the brain is affected. If the abnormal electrical brain function is in the part of the brain involved with vision (occipital lobe), your child’s sight may be altered. More often, muscles are affected. The seizure activity is limited to an isolated muscle group. For example, it may only include the fingers, or larger muscles in the arms and legs. Your child may also have sweating, nausea, or become pale. Your child won’t lose consciousness in this type of seizure.
Complex focal seizure. This type of seizure often occurs in the area of the brain that controls emotion and memory function (temporal lobe). Your child will likely lose consciousness. This may not mean he or she will pass out. Your child may just stop being aware of what's going on around him or her. Your child may look awake, but have a variety of unusual behaviors. These may range from gagging, lip smacking, running, screaming, crying, or laughing. Your child may be tired or sleepy after the seizure. This is called the postictal period.
Generalized seizure
A generalized seizure occurs in both sides of the brain. Your child will lose consciousness and be tired after the seizure (postictal state). Types of generalized seizures include:
Absence seizure . This is also called petit mal seizure. This seizure causes a brief changed state of consciousness and staring. Your child will likely maintain posture. His or her mouth or face may twitch or eyes may blink rapidly. The seizure usually lasts no longer than 30 seconds. When the seizure is over, your child may not recall what just occurred. He or she may go on with activities as though nothing happened. These seizures may occur several times a day. This type of seizure is sometimes mistaken for a learning or behavioral problem. Absence seizures almost always start between ages 4 to 12.
Atonic seizure. This is also called a drop attack. With an atonic seizure, your child has a sudden loss of muscle tone and may fall from a standing position or suddenly drop his or her head. During the seizure, your child will be limp and unresponsive.
Generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTC). This is also called grand mal seizure. The classic form of this kind of seizure has 5 distinct phases. Your child’s body, arms, and legs will flex (contract), extend (straighten out), and tremor (shake). This is followed by contraction and relaxation of the muscles (clonic period) and the postictal period. During the postictal period, your child may be sleepy. He or she may have problems with vision or speech, and may have a bad headache, fatigue, or body aches. Not all of these phases occur in everyone with this type of seizure.
Myoclonic seizure. This type of seizure causes quick movements or sudden jerking of a group of muscles. These seizures tend to occur in clusters. This means that they may occur several times a day, or for several days in a row.
What causes a seizure in a child?
A seizure can be caused by many things. These can include:
An imbalance of nerve-signaling brain chemicals (neurotransmitters)
Brain tumor
Stroke
Brain damage from illness or injury
A seizure may be caused by a combination of these. In most cases, the cause of a seizure can’t be found.
What are the symptoms of a seizure in a child?
Your child’s symptoms depend on the type of seizure. General symptoms or warning signs of a seizure can include:
Staring
Jerking movements of the arms and legs
Stiffening of the body
Loss of consciousness
Breathing problems or stopping breathing
Loss of bowel or bladder control
Falling suddenly for no apparent reason, especially when associated with loss of consciousness
Not responding to noise or words for brief periods
Appearing confused or in a haze
Nodding head rhythmically, when associated with loss of awareness or consciousness
Periods of rapid eye blinking and staring
During the seizure, your child’s lips may become tinted blue and his or her breathing may not be normal. After the seizure, your child may be sleepy or confused.
The symptoms of a seizure may be like those of other health conditions. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How are seizures diagnosed in a child?
The healthcare provider will ask about your child’s symptoms and health history. You’ll be asked about other factors that may have caused your child’s seizure, such as:
Recent fever or infection
Head injury
Congenital health conditions
Preterm birth
Recent medicines
Your child may also have:
A neurological exam
Blood tests to check for problems in blood sugar and other factors
Imaging tests of the brain, such as an MRI or CT scan
Electroencephalogram , to test the electrical activity in your child’s brain
Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) , to measure the pressure in the brain and spinal canal and test the cerebral spinal fluid for infection or other problems
How are seizures treated in a child?
The goal of treatment is to control, stop, or reduce how often seizures occur. Treatment is most often done with medicine. Many types of medicines used to treat seizures and epilepsy. Your child’s healthcare provider will need to identify the type of seizure your child is having. Medicines are selected based on the type of seizure, age of the child, side effects, cost, and ease of use. Medicines used at home are usually taken by mouth as capsules, tablets, sprinkles, or syrup. Some medicines can be given into the rectum or in the nose. If your child is in the hospital with seizures, medicine may be given by injection or intravenously by vein (IV).
It is important to give your child medicine on time and as prescribed. The dose may need to be adjusted for the best seizure control. All medicines can have side effects. Talk with your child’s healthcare provider about possible side effects. If your child has side effects, talk to the healthcare provider. Do not stop giving medicine to your child. This can cause more or worse seizures.
While your child is taking medicine, he or she may need tests to see how well the medicine is working. You may have:
Blood tests. Your child may need blood tests often to check the level of medicine in his or her body. Based on this level, the healthcare provider may change the dose of medicine. Your child may also have blood tests to check the effects of the medicine on his or her other organs.
Urine tests. Your child’s urine may be tested to see how his or her body is reacting to the medicine.
Electroencephalogram (EEG). An EEG is a procedure that records the brain's electrical activity. This is done by attaching electrodes to the scalp. This test is done to see how medicine is helping the electrical problems in your child’s brain.
Your child may not need medicine for life. Some children are taken off medicine if they have had no seizures for 1 to 2 years. This will be determined by your child's healthcare provider.
Other treatments
If medicine doesn’t work well enough for your child to control seizures or your child has problems with side effects, the healthcare provider may advise other types of treatment. Your child may be treated with any of the below:
Ketogenic diet
A ketogenic diet is a type of diet is very high in fat, and very low in carbohydrates. Enough protein is included to help promote growth. The diet causes the body to make ketones. These are chemicals made from the breakdown of body fat. The brain and heart work normally with ketones as an energy source. This special diet must be strictly followed. Too many carbohydrates can stop ketosis. Researchers aren’t sure why the diet works. But some children become seizure-free when put on the diet. The diet doesn’t work for every child.
Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS)
This treatment sends small pulses of energy to the brain from one of the vagus nerves. This is a pair of large nerves in the neck. If your child is age 12 or older and has partial seizures that are not controlled well with medicine, VNS may be an option. VNS is done by surgically placing a small battery into the chest wall. Small wires are then attached to the battery and placed under the skin and around one of the vagus nerves. The battery is then programmed to send energy impulses every few minutes to the brain. When your child feels a seizure coming on, he or she may activate the impulses by holding a small magnet over the battery. In many cases, this will help to stop the seizure. VNS can have side effects such as hoarse voice, pain in the throat, or change in voice.
Surgery
Surgery may be done to remove the part of the brain where the seizures are occurring. Or the surgery helps to stop the spread of the bad electrical currents through the brain. Surgery may be an option if your child’s seizures are hard to control and always start in one part of the brain that doesn’t affect speech, memory, or vision. Surgery for epilepsy seizures is very complex. It is done by a specialized surgical team. Your child may be awake during the surgery. The brain itself does not feel pain. If your child is awake and able to follow commands, the surgeons are better able to check areas of his or her brain during the procedure. Surgery is not an option for everyone with seizures.
How can I help my child live with epilepsy?
You can help your child with epilepsy manage his or her health. Make sure to:
If age-appropriate, make sure your child understands the type of seizure he or she has, and the type of medicine that is needed.
Know the dose, time, and side effects of all medicines. Give your child medicine exactly as directed.
Talk with your child's healthcare provider before giving your child other medicines. Medicines for seizures can interact with many other medicines. This can cause the medicines to not work well, or cause side effects.
Help your child avoid anything that may trigger a seizure. Make sure your child gets enough sleep, as lack of sleep can trigger a seizure.
Make sure your child visits his or her healthcare provider regularly. Have your child tested as often as needed.
Keep in mind that your child may not need medicine for life. Talk with the healthcare provider if your child has had no seizures for 1 to 2 years.
If your child’s seizures are controlled well, you may not need many restrictions on activities. Make sure your child wears a helmet for sports such as skating, hockey, and bike riding. Make sure your child has adult supervision while swimming.
When should I call my child’s healthcare provider?
Call the healthcare provider if:
Your child’s symptoms get worse or do not get better
Your child has side effects from medicine
Key points about epilepsy and seizures in children
A seizure occurs when one or more parts of the brain has a burst of abnormal electrical signals that interrupt normal signals
There are many types of seizures. Each can cause different kinds of symptoms. These range from slight body movements to loss of consciousness and convulsions.
Epilepsy is when a person has 2 or more seizures with no known cause.
Epilepsy is treated with medicine. In some cases, it may be treated with VNS or surgery.
It’s important to avoid anything that triggers seizures. This includes lack of sleep."
Epispadias,"What is epispadias?
Epispadias is a rare birth defect located at the opening of the urethra. In this condition, the urethra does not develop into a full tube, and the urine exits the body from an abnormal location. The causes of epispadias are unknown. It may be related to improper development of the pubic bone. In boys with epispadias, the urethra generally opens on the top or side of the penis rather than the tip. However, it is possible for the urethra to be open along the entire length of the penis. In girls, the opening is usually between the clitoris and the labia but may be in the belly area.
Epispadias can be associated with bladder exstrophy, an uncommon birth defect in which the bladder is inside out and sticks through the abdominal wall. However, epispadias can also occur with other defects. Epispadias occurs in one in 117,000 newborn boys and one in 484,000 newborn girls. The condition is usually diagnosed at birth or shortly thereafter.
Symptoms
In males:
Abnormal opening from the joint between the pubic bones to the area above the tip of the penis
Backward flow of urine into the kidney (reflux nephropathy)
Short, widened penis with an abnormal curvature
Urinary tract infections
Widened pubic bone
In females:
Abnormal clitoris and labia
Abnormal opening from the bladder neck to the area above the normal urethral opening
Backward flow of urine into the kidney (reflux nephropathy)
Widened pubic bone
Urinary incontinence
Urinary tract infections
Diagnosis
Blood test to check electrolyte levels
Intravenous pyelogram (IVP), a special X-ray of the kidneys, bladder and ureters
MRI and CT scans, depending on the condition
Pelvic X-ray
Ultrasound of the urogenital system
Treatment
Surgical repair of epispadias is recommended in patients with more than a mild case. Leakage of urine (incontinence) is not uncommon and may require a second operation. Surgery generally leads to the ability to control the flow of urine and a good cosmetic outcome. Persistent urinary incontinence can occur in some people with this condition even after several operations. Upper urinary tract (ureter and kidney) damage and infertility may occur.

Esophageal atresia,"What is esophageal atresia?
Esophageal atresia is a disorder of the digestive system in which the esophagus, the tube that normally carries food from the mouth to the stomach, does not develop properly before birth. In most cases, the upper esophagus ends and does not connect with the lower esophagus and stomach. The top end of the lower esophagus connects to the windpipe. This connection is called a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). Some babies with TEF will also have other problems, such as heart or other digestive tract disorders. Other types of esophageal atresia involve narrowing of the esophagus.
Symptoms
Bluish coloration to the skin (cyanosis) with attempted feedings
Coughing, gagging and choking with attempted feeding
Drooling
Poor feeding
Diagnosis
Before birth, an ultrasound performed on the pregnant mother may show too much amniotic fluid, which can be a sign of esophageal atresia.
After birth, the disorder is usually detected when feeding is attempted and the infant coughs, chokes and turns blue. As soon as esophageal atresia is suspected, an attempt to pass a small feeding tube through the mouth or nose into the stomach should be made. The feeding tube will not be able to pass all the way to the stomach in a baby with esophageal atresia.
An X-ray of the esophagus shows an air-filled pouch and air in the stomach and intestine. A feeding tube will appear coiled up in the upper esophagus.
Treatment
Esophageal atresia is considered a surgical emergency. Surgery to repair the esophagus should be done quickly after the baby is stabilized so that the lungs are not damaged and the baby can be fed. Before the surgery, the baby is not fed by mouth. Care is taken to prevent the baby from breathing secretions into the lungs.
Prognosis
An early diagnosis gives a better chance of a good outcome."
Esophageal reflux,"What is GERD?
GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a long-term (chronic) digestive disorder. It happens when stomach contents flow back up (reflux) into the food pipe (esophagus).
GERD is a more serious and long-lasting form of gastroesophageal reflux (GER).
GER is common in babies under 2 years old. Most babies spit up a few times a day during their first 3 months. GER does not cause any problems in babies. In most cases, babies outgrow this by the time they are 12 to 14 months old.
It is also common for children and teens ages 2 to 19 to have GER from time to time. This doesn’t always mean they have GERD.
When GER becomes GERD
Your baby, child, or teen may have GERD if:
Your baby’s symptoms prevent him or her from feeding. These symptoms may include vomiting, gagging, coughing, and trouble breathing.
Your baby has GER for more than 12 to 14 months
Your child or teen has GER more than 2 times a week, for a few months 
What causes GERD?
GERD is often caused by something that affects the LES, the lower esophageal sphincter. The LES is a muscle at the bottom of the food pipe (esophagus). The LES opens to let food into the stomach. It closes to keep food in the stomach. When the LES relaxes too often or for too long, stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. This causes vomiting or heartburn.
Everyone has reflux from time to time. If you have ever burped and had an acid taste in your mouth, you have had reflux. Sometimes the LES relaxes at the wrong times. Often your child will just have a bad taste in his or her mouth. Or your child may have a short, mild feeling of heartburn.
Babies are more likely to have a weak LES. This makes the LES relax when it should stay shut. As food or milk is digesting, the LES opens. It lets the stomach contents go back up to the esophagus. Sometimes the stomach contents go all the way up the esophagus. Then the baby or child vomits. In other cases, the stomach contents only go part of the way up the esophagus. This causes heartburn or breathing problems. In some cases there are no symptoms at all.
Some foods seem to affect the muscle tone of the LES. They let the LES stay open longer than normal. These foods include:
Chocolate
Peppermint
High-fat foods
Other foods cause the stomach to make more acid. These foods include:
Citrus foods
Tomatoes and tomato sauces
Other things that may lead to GERD include:
Being obese
Medicines, including some antihistamines, antidepressants, and pain medicines
Being around secondhand smoke
What are the risk factors for GERD?
GERD is very common during a baby’s first year of life. It often goes away on its own. Your child is more at risk for GERD if he or she has:
Down syndrome
Neuromuscular disorders such as muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy
What are the symptoms of GERD?
Heartburn, or acid indigestion, is the most common symptom of GERD. Heartburn is described as a burning chest pain. It begins behind the breastbone and moves up to the neck and throat. It can last as long as 2 hours. It is often worse after eating. Lying down or bending over after a meal can also lead to heartburn.
Children younger than age 12 will often have different GERD symptoms. They will have a dry cough, asthma symptoms, or trouble swallowing. They won’t have classic heartburn.
Each child may have different symptoms. Common symptoms of GERD include:
Burping or belching
Not eating
Having stomach pain
Being fussy around mealtimes
Vomiting often
Having hiccups
Gagging
Choking
Coughing often
Having coughing fits at night
Other symptoms may include:
Wheezing
Getting colds often
Getting ear infections often
Having a rattling in the chest
Having a sore throat in the morning
Having a sour taste in the mouth
Having bad breath
Loss or decay of tooth enamel
GERD symptoms may seem like other health problems. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is GERD diagnosed?
Your child's healthcare provider will do a physical exam and take a health history. Other tests may include:
Chest X-ray. An X-ray can check for signs that stomach contents have moved into the lungs. This is called aspiration.
Upper GI series or barium swallow. This test looks at the organs of the top part of your child’s digestive system. It checks the food pipe (esophagus), the stomach, and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Your child will swallow a metallic fluid called barium. Barium coats the organs so that they can be seen on an X-ray. Then X-rays are taken to check for signs of sores or ulcers, or abnormal blockages.
Endoscopy. This test checks the inside of part of the digestive tract. It uses a small, flexible tube called an endoscope. It has a light and a camera lens at the end. Tissue samples from inside the digestive tract may also be taken for testing.
Esophageal manometry. This test checks the strength of the esophagus muscles. It can see if your child has any problems with reflux or swallowing. A small tube is put into your child’s nostril, then down the throat and into the esophagus. Then it measures the pressure that the esophageal muscles make at rest.
pH monitoring. This test checks the pH or acid level in the esophagus. A thin, plastic tube is placed into your child’s nostril, down the throat, and into the esophagus. The tube has a sensor that measures pH level. The other end of the tube outside your child’s body is attached to a small monitor. This records your child’s pH levels for 24 to 48 hours. During this time your child can go home and do his or her normal activities. You will need to keep a diary of any symptoms your child feels that may be linked to reflux. These include gagging or coughing. You should also keep a record of the time, type of food, and amount of food your child eats. Your child’s pH readings are checked. They are compared to your child’s activity for that time period.
Gastric emptying study. This test is done to see if your child’s stomach sends its contents into the small intestine properly. Delayed gastric emptying can cause reflux into the esophagus
How is GERD treated?
Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
Diet and lifestyle changes
In many cases, diet and lifestyle changes can help to ease GERD. Talk with your child’s healthcare provider about changes you can make. Here are some tips to better manage GERD symptoms.
For babies:
After feedings, hold your baby in an upright position for 30 minutes.
If bottle-feeding, keep the nipple filled with milk. This way your baby won’t swallow too much air while eating. Try different nipples. Find one that lets your baby's mouth make a good seal with the nipple during feeding.
Adding rice cereal to feeding may be helpful for some babies.
Burp your baby a few times during bottle-feeding or breastfeeding. Your child may reflux more often when burping with a full stomach.
For children:
Watch your child's food intake. Limit fried and fatty foods, peppermint, chocolate, drinks with caffeine such as sodas and tea, citrus fruit and juices, and tomato products.
Offer your child smaller portions at mealtimes. Add small snacks between meals if your child is hungry. Don’t let your child overeat. Let your child tell you when he or she is hungry or full.
If your child is overweight, contact your child’s provider to set weight-loss goals.
Serve the evening meal early, at least 3 hours before bedtime.
Other things to try:
Ask your child's provider to review your child’s medicines. Some may irritate the lining of the stomach or esophagus.
Don’t let your child lie down or go to bed right after a meal.
Always check with your baby’s provider before raising the head of the crib if he or she has been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux. This is for safety reasons and to reduce the risk for SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths. 
Medicines and other treatments
Your child’s healthcare provider may also recommend other options.
Medicines. Your child's provider may prescribe medicines to help with reflux. There are medicines that help reduce the amount of acid the stomach makes. This reduces the heartburn linked to reflux. These medicines may include:
H2-blockers. These reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes by blocking the hormone histamine. Histamine helps to make acid.
Proton pump inhibitors. These help keep your stomach from making acid. They do this by stopping the stomach's acid pump from working.
The provider may prescribe another type of medicine that helps the stomach empty faster. If food doesn’t stay in the stomach as long as normal, reflex may be less likely to occur.  
Calorie supplements. Some babies with reflux can’t gain weight because they vomit often. If this is the case, your child's healthcare provider may suggest:
Adding rice cereal to baby formula
Giving your baby more calories by adding a prescribed supplement
Changing formula to milk- or soy-free formula if your baby may have an allergy
Tube feedings. In some cases tube feedings may be recommended. Some babies with reflux have other conditions that make them tired. These include congenital heart disease or being born too early (premature). These babies often get sleepy after they eat or drink a little. Other babies vomit after having a normal amount of formula. These babies do better if they are constantly fed a small amount of milk. In both of these cases, tube feedings may be suggested. Formula or breastmilk is given through a tube that is placed in the nose. This is called a nasogastric tube. The tube is then put through the food pipe or esophagus, and into the stomach. Your baby can have a tube feeding in addition to a bottle feeding. Or a tube feeding may be done instead of a bottle feeding. There are also tubes that can be used to go around, or bypass, the stomach. These are called nasoduodenal tubes.
Surgery. In severe cases of reflux, surgery called fundoplication may be done. Your baby’s provider may recommend this option if your child is not gaining weight because of vomiting, has frequent breathing problems, or has severe irritation in the esophagus. This is often done as a laparoscopic surgery. This method has less pain and a faster recovery time. Small cuts or incisions are made in your child’s belly. A small tube with a camera on the end is placed into one of the incisions to look inside. The surgical tools are put through the other incisions. The surgeon looks at a video screen to see the stomach and other organs. The top part of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus. This creates a tight band. This strengthens the LES and greatly decreases reflux.
What are the complications of GERD?
Some babies and children who have GERD may not vomit. But their stomach contents may still move up the food pipe (esophagus) and spill over into the windpipe (trachea). This can cause asthma or pneumonia.
The vomiting that affects many babies and children with GERD can cause problems with weight gain and poor nutrition. Over time, when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, it can also lead to:
Inflammation of the esophagus, called esophagitis
Sores or ulcers in the esophagus, which can be painful and may bleed
A lack of red blood cells, from bleeding sores (anemia)
Adults may also have long-term problems from inflammation of the esophagus. These include:
Narrowing, or stricture, of the esophagus
Barrett’s esophagus, a condition where there are abnormal cells in the esophageal lining
Living with GERD
Many babies who vomit outgrow it by the time they are about 1 year old. This happens as the LES gets stronger. For other children, taking medicines and making lifestyle and diet changes can reduce reflux, vomiting, and heartburn.
When should I call my child's healthcare provider?
Call you child's healthcare provider if your baby or child:
Has reflux and is not gaining weight
Has signs of asthma or pneumonia. These include coughing, wheezing, or trouble breathing.
Key points about GERD
GERD is a long-term (chronic) digestive disorder.
It happens when stomach contents come back up into the food pipe (esophagus).
Heartburn or acid indigestion is the most common symptom of GERD.
Vomiting can cause problems with weight gain and poor nutrition.
In many cases, GERD can be eased by diet and lifestyle changes.
Sometimes medicines, tube feedings, or surgery may be needed.
Next steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Ewing’s sarcoma,"Ewing’s sarcoma is a cancerous bone tumor affecting children and young adults. It gets its name from Dr. James Ewing, the doctor who first described the tumor in the 1920s. Ewing’s sarcoma may arise anywhere in the body, but it usually originates in the long bones of the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. Though more rare, it may also develop in the skull or flat bones of the trunk. While it is most often a bone tumor, Ewing’s sarcoma can develop in the soft tissue near bones as well. Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) are molecularly related tumors that often arise outside of the bone. Treatment is the same as Ewing’s sarcoma. Read more on Sarcomas. While Ewing’s sarcoma can occur anytime during childhood, it develops most commonly during puberty, when bones are growing rapidly. This type of cancer is uncommon in African-American, African, and Chinese children.
Ewings Sarcoma Symptoms
Symptoms of Ewing’s sarcoma include: pain in the bone where the tumor is located; swelling in the area of the tumor, and tenderness to touch; occasionally, a fever may develop; or the child may have a broken bone after a seemingly minor fall or accident.
Ewings Sarcoma Diagnostic Tests
The doctor may order a variety of tests to diagnose Ewing’s sarcoma. An X-ray of the painful part of the bone may be done to see if a tumor is present. Other tests administered to obtain an image of the tumor and determine if it has spread beyond the bone include: a CT (computerized tomography) scan, an MRI (magentic resonance imaging) scan, a chest X-ray, and a bone scan (scintigraphy). A bone scan detects areas of increased or decreased bone metabolism and can identify abnormal processes involving the bone, including a tumor.
These imaging tests are typically noninvasive and painless. A biopsy will be needed to make the diagnosis. A biopsy is a surgical procedure used to obtain a sample of the tumor so that it can be examined under a microscope and tested in other ways.
Ewings Sarcoma Treatment
Treatment is usually a combination of therapies including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The exact type of treatment a patient receives depends upon the size, position, and spread of the tumor.
Chemotherapy, treatment with anticancer drugs, is usually done first to shrink the primary or main tumor. A specialist, called an orthopedic surgeon, will then remove the tumor surgically.
The surgeon will make every effort to remove the tumor without causing too much damage to the limb. This is called limb-sparing surgery. In this type of surgery, the diseased part of the bone is removed and replaced with an artificial piece (prosthesis) or piece of bone from a bone bank (bone graft).
After this type of surgery, the patient usually regains nearly normal use of the limb. If the child is growing, and an artificial piece was used to replace the diseased bone, additional surgeries may be required to lengthen the artificial bone as the child grows. The doctor may advise against contact sports as well, because, if the bone graft or prosthesis is damaged, another major operation may be needed to repair or replace it.
If the tumor is in one of the main bones of the arm or leg and has affected surrounding blood vessels and nerves, surgery to remove the entire limb (amputation) may be necessary. Though the prospect of amputation is alarming to families and patients, children fitted with artificial limbs are usually able to resume normal activities and even play sports. Artificial limbs are precisely fitted to each child and are adjusted regularly as the child grows.
Radiation therapy, targeted X-rays that kill cancer cells, may be given if surgery to remove the tumor is not possible. In addition , chemotherapy will be given following surgery or radiation therapy to destroy any tumor cells that may have spread to other parts of the body.
Most patients with Ewing’s sarcoma can be cured. Even if the tumor comes back, additional treatment with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy may be successful. Surgery and radiation therapy can stop bones from growing and may result in asymetry. As a result, some children may require corrective surgeries later in life. Most patients successfully treated for Ewing’s sarcoma grow up with little disability."
Exstrophy variants,"Pseudoexstrophy: This is a type of exstrophy (see classic bladder exstrophy). The pelvic bones have the same defect as seen with exstrophy, but the bladder and the urinary tract are normal.
Superior vesical fissure: The pelvic bones are abnormal as seen in classic bladder exstrophy, but only the uppermost end of the bladder is opened near the belly button.
Duplicate exstrophy: The pelvic bones may be abnormal as in classic bladder exstrophy, but a separate piece of the bladder is opened and flattened on the wall of the abdomen. The remainder of the bladder is normal and within the abdomen. The normal bladder is most often in the pelvis posterior to the exstrophied bladder but can be side to side.
Covered exstrophy:The pelvic bones have the abnormality as seen in classic bladder exstrophy. A piece of bowel is opened on the wall of the abdomen. The urethra (channel that goes from the bladder to the outside through the penis) is also opened (see epispadias).

Facial paralysis,"An inability to move the muscles of the face on one or both sides is known as facial paralysis. Facial paralysis can result from nerve damage due to congenital (present at birth) conditions, trauma or disease, such as stroke, brain tumor or Bell’s palsy.
The problem can affect one or both sides of the face, with noticeable drooping of the features and problems with speaking, blinking, swallowing saliva, eating or communicating through natural facial expressions.  
Treatment for Facial Paralysis
Paralysis of the face may be temporary or permanent. The facial plastic surgery team determines the best treatment based on how long the paralysis has been present, the cause and whether it is a complete paralysis, or an incomplete (or partial) paralysis."
Failure to thrive,"What is failure to thrive?
Children are diagnosed with failure to thrive when their weight or rate of weight gain is significantly below that of other children of similar age and sex. Infants or children that fail to thrive seem to be dramatically smaller or shorter than other children the same age. Teenagers may have short stature or appear to lack the usual changes that occur at puberty. However, there is a wide variation in what is considered normal growth and development.
Symptoms
In general, the rate of change in weight and height may be more important than the actual measurements.
Infants or children who fail to thrive have a height, weight and head circumference that do not match standard growth charts. The person's weight falls lower than the third percentile (as outlined in standard growth charts) or 20 percent below the ideal weight for their height. Growing may have slowed or stopped after a previously established growth curve.
The following are delayed or slow to develop:
Physical skills, such as rolling over, sitting, standing and walking
Mental and social skills
Secondary sexual characteristics (delayed in adolescents)
Diagnosis
It is important to determine whether failure to thrive results from medical problems or factors in the environment, such as abuse or neglect.
There are multiple medical causes of failure to thrive. These include:
Chromosome abnormalities, such as Down syndrome and Turner syndrome
Defects in major organ systems
Problems with the endocrine system, such as thyroid hormone deficiency, growth hormone deficiency or other hormone deficiencies
Damage to the brain or central nervous system, which may cause feeding difficulties in an infant
Heart or lung problems, which can affect how oxygen and nutrients move through the body
Anemia or other blood disorders
Gastrointestinal problems that result in malabsorption or a lack of digestive enzymes
Long-term gastroenteritis and gastroesophageal reflux (usually temporary)
Cerebral palsy
Long-term (chronic) infections
Metabolic disorders
Complications of pregnancy and low birth weight
Other factors that may lead to failure to thrive:
Emotional deprivation as a result of parental withdrawal, rejection or hostility
Economic problems that affect nutrition, living conditions and parental attitudes
Exposure to infections, parasites or toxins
Poor eating habits, such as eating in front of the television and not having formal meal times
Many times the cause cannot be determined.
Treatment
The treatment depends on the cause of the delayed growth and development. Delayed growth due to nutritional factors can be resolved by educating the parents to provide a well-balanced diet.
If psychosocial factors are involved, treatment should include improving the family dynamics and living conditions. Parental attitudes and behavior may contribute to a child's problems and need to be examined. In many cases, a child may need to be hospitalized initially to focus on implementation of a comprehensive medical, behavioral and psychosocial treatment plan.
Do not give your child dietary supplements without consulting your physician first."
Feeding problems,"What are Feeding Problems
Poor feeding, a lack of interest in feeding or a problem receiving the proper amount of nutrition, is a nonspecific symptom seen in newborn and young infants that can result from many conditions, including infection, metabolic disorders, genetic disorders, structural abnormalities, and neurological disorders. Poor feeding is not an indicator of the severity of the disease, but it is an indicator that (even in the absence of other symptoms) suggests close watching of the infant. Poor feeding is not the same as “picky” eating. Many children between ages 2 and 4 are picky eaters.
Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of feeding problems include dehydration, failure to thrive and malnutrition.
Diagnosis
A child who is feeding poorly will often have other symptoms and signs that, when taken together, define a specific syndrome or condition. Diagnosis of that condition is based on a family history, medical history, and a complete physical exam. Laboratory studies such as x-rays, gastrointestinal (GI) studies, and blood tests may be ordered.
 "
Femoral anteversion,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Femoral anteversion describes the inward rotation of the femur bone in the upper leg.
Femoral anteversion occurs in up to 10 percent of children; 99 percent of cases resolve over time without the need for surgery.
In many cases, the abnormal rotation of the femur develops while the fetus is growing in the womb.
In children older than 3, femoral anteversion is the most common cause of in-toeing (walking with feet angled toward each other)."
Fever,"What is a fever?
A fever is a body temperature that is higher than normal. It usually means there is an abnormal process occurring in the body. Exercise, hot weather, and common childhood immunizations can also make body temperature rise.
What causes a fever?
A fever is not an illness by itself. Rather it is a symptom that something is not right within the body. A fever does not tell you what is causing it, or even that a disease is present. It may be a bacterial or viral infection. Or, it could be a reaction from an allergy to food or medicine. Becoming overheated at play or in the sun can also result in fever.
What are the symptoms of a fever?
Normal body temperature ranges from 97.5°F to 98.9°F (36.4°C to 37.2°C). It tends to be lower in the morning and higher in the evening. Most healthcare providers consider a fever to be 100.4°F (38°C) or higher. High fevers may bring on seizures or confusion in children. It's not how high the temperature is, but how fast the temperature goes up that causes a seizure.
A fever has other symptoms besides a higher-than-normal temperature. These are especially important when caring for babies, young children, and disabled people. These groups may not be able to express how they feel. Signs that mean fever include:
Flushed face
Hot, dry skin
Low output of urine, or dark urine
Not interested in eating
Constipation or diarrhea
Vomiting
Headache
Aching all over
Nausea
How is a fever diagnosed?
The best way to diagnose a fever is to take a temperature with a thermometer. There are several types of thermometers, including the following:
Digital thermometer (oral, rectal, or under the armpit)
Tympanic (ear) thermometer (not recommended in babies younger than 6 months of age)
Temporal artery (temperature taken across the forehead area)
Taking a temperature rectally is the most accurate method in children under 3 years of age. In older children and adults, take the temperature under the armpit or in the mouth. Talk with your healthcare provider about the best way to take your temperature.
Most thermometers today are digital, but there are some glass thermometers containing mercury still in use. Mercury is toxic substance and is dangerous to humans and the environment. Because glass thermometers can break, they should be disposed of properly in accordance with local, state, and federal laws. For information on how to safely dispose of a mercury thermometer, contact your local health department, waste disposal authority, or fire department.
How is a fever treated?
You can treat a fever with acetaminophen or ibuprofen in dosages advised by your healthcare provider. Switching between giving acetaminophen and ibuprofen can cause medicine errors and may lead to side effects. Never give aspirin to a child or young adult who has a fever.
A lukewarm bath may reduce the fever. Alcohol rubdowns are no longer recommended.
Call your healthcare provider for guidance anytime you are uncomfortable with the conditions of the fever, and remember to contact your healthcare provider any time a temperature spikes quickly or persists despite treatment.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call your healthcare provider right away for a fever in a baby younger than 3 months old.
Call right away or seek immediate medical attention if any of the following occur with a fever:
Seizure
Feeling dull or sleepy
Irregular breathing
Stiff neck
Confusion
Purple spotted rash
Ear pain (a child tugging on his or her ear)
Sore throat that persists
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Painful, burning, or frequent urination
Key points about fevers
A fever is not an illness by itself, but, rather, a sign that something is not right within the body.
Illness, exercise, hot weather, and common childhood immunizations can make body temperature rise.
In addition to an elevated temperature, look for other signs, such as: flushed face, hot skin, low urine output, loss of appetite, headache, or other symptoms of an infection or illness.
Once you have determined that the person has a fever, you may treat it by giving acetaminophen or ibuprofen in dosages advised by your healthcare provider.
Call your healthcare provider if a baby under 3 months has a fever, or seek immediate medical attention if a fever is accompanied by a seizure, lethargy, irregular breathing, stiff neck, confusion, or other signs of a serious illness.

Folate deficiency,"What is folate-deficiency anemia?
Folate-deficiency anemia is the lack of folic acid in the blood. Folic acid is a B vitamin that helps your body make red blood cells. If you don’t have enough red blood cells, you have anemia.
Red blood cells carry oxygen to all parts of your body. When you have anemia, your blood can’t bring enough oxygen to all your tissues and organs. Without enough oxygen, your body can’t work as well as it should.
Low levels of folic acid can cause megaloblastic anemia. With this condition, red blood cells are larger than normal. There are fewer of these cells. They are also oval-shaped, not round. Sometimes these red blood cells don’t live as long as normal red blood cells.
What causes folate-deficiency anemia?
You can develop folate-deficiency anemia if:
You don’t eat enough foods that have folic acid. These include green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, fortified cereals, yeast, and meats (including liver).
You drink too much alcohol
You have certain diseases of the lower digestive tract, such as celiac disease. This type of anemia also occurs in people with cancer.
You take certain medicines, such as some used for seizures.
You are pregnant. This is because the developing baby needs more folic acid. Also, the mother absorbs it more slowly. A lack of folate during pregnancy is linked to major birth defects that affect the brain, spinal cord, and spine (neural tube defects).
Some babies are born unable to absorb folic acid. This can lead to megaloblastic anemia. With this condition, red blood cells are larger than normal. They also have a different shape. Early treatment is needed to prevent problems such as poor reasoning and learning.
Who is at risk for folate-deficiency anemia?
You are more likely to have this type of anemia if you:
Don’t eat a healthy diet
Drink a lot of alcohol
Are pregnant
Can’t absorb folic acid
Are taking certain medicines, such as those used to control seizures
What are the symptoms of folate-deficiency anemia?
Symptoms may include:
Pale skin
Decreased appetite
Being grouchy (irritable)
Lack of energy or tiring easily
Diarrhea
Smooth and tender tongue
The symptoms of folate-deficiency anemia may look like other blood conditions or health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is folate-deficiency anemia diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider may think you have this type of anemia after taking your medical history and doing a physical exam. You may have several blood tests to confirm the diagnosis. You may also have a barium study if a digestive problem is the cause.
How is folate-deficiency anemia treated?
Your healthcare provider will figure out the best treatment based on:
Your age, overall health, and medical history
How sick you are
How well you can handle certain medicines, treatments, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Treatment may include:
Vitamin and mineral supplements
Changes in your diet
Medicine
Treating the underlying disease
You may need to take folic acid supplements for at least 2 to 3 months. These may be pills or shots (injections). Eating foods high in folic acid and cutting your alcohol intake are also important. If a digestive tract problem causes your anemia, your provider may treat that first.
What are the complications of folate-deficiency anemia?
Folate-deficiency anemia during pregnancy may cause a neural tube defect. This is when the brain or spinal cord doesn’t develop normally. It can cause death before or soon after birth. Or it may cause paralysis of the legs.
Key points about folate-deficiency anemia
Most folate-deficiency anemia is caused by a lack of folic acid in the diet.
Leafy vegetables, citrus fruits, beans, and whole grains are natural sources of folic acid.
Folate-deficiency anemia in pregnancy may cause a neural tube defect. This is when the brain or spinal cord doesn’t develop normally.
Treatment includes a well-balanced diet of foods with folic acid, folic acid supplements, medicines, and treating underlying diseases.

Food allergies,"What is food allergy?
A food allergy is an abnormal response of the body's immune system to certain foods. This is not the same as food intolerance, although some of the symptoms may be very similar.
What causes food allergies?
Your body’s immune system fights off infections and other dangers to keep you healthy. When your immune system senses that a food or something in a food is a “danger” to your health, you have a food allergy reaction. Your immune system sends out immunoglobulin E or IgE antibodies. These react to the food or substance in the food. This can cause allergy symptoms such as hives, asthma, itching in the mouth, trouble breathing, stomach pains, vomiting, or diarrhea.
Which foods most often cause food allergies?
About 9 in 10 food allergies are caused by these foods:
Milk
Eggs
Wheat
Soy
Tree nuts
Fish
Shellfish
Peanuts
Some facts about food allergies:
Eggs, milk, and peanuts are the most common causes of food allergies in children.
Peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish commonly cause the most severe reactions.
Nearly 1 in 20 children under the age of 5 years have food allergies.
From 1997 to 2007, food allergies increased by 18% among children under age 18 years.
Most children ""outgrow"" their allergies. But allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, and shellfish may be lifelong.
According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, it doesn't take much food to cause a severe allergic reaction—1/44,000 of a peanut can cause a severe reaction in a highly allergic person.
What are the symptoms of food allergies?
Allergic symptoms may begin within minutes to an hour after eating the food. The following are the most common symptoms of a food allergy. But symptoms may occur a bit differently for each person. Symptoms may include:
Swelling and itching of lips and mouth
Tightness in the throat or hoarse voice
Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea and cramps
Itchy, raised bumps (hives)
Swelling of the skin
Itching
The symptoms of a food allergy may look like other health conditions or problems. Always talk with your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
What are severe symptoms of food allergy?
Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction. It is life-threatening. Symptoms can include those above as well as the following:
Trouble breathing or wheezing
Feeling as if the throat is closing or that the lips and tongue are swelling 
Flushing of the skin
Itching of palms and soles of feet
Feeling faint
Nausea
Fast pulse
Low blood pressure
Loss of consciousness
Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency. Call 911 to get help right away. Severe allergic reactions are treated with epinephrine. If you know you have severe allergies, you should carry an emergency kit with self-injecting epinephrine or Epi-pens.
Treatment for food allergies in adults
The goal of treatment is to stay away from the food that causes the allergic symptoms. There is no medicine to prevent food allergies, although research is ongoing.
You need to be prepared in case you eat something with the food that causes your allergic reaction. You may need an emergency kit to stop severe reactions. Talk with your healthcare provider about what you should do.
Medicines are available for some symptoms caused by food allergy after the food has been eaten. Discuss available medicines with your healthcare provider.
Treatment of food allergies in children
As in adults, it is very important that your child stays away from foods that cause allergies. If you are breastfeeding your child, it is important that you not eat foods to which your child is allergic.
You may need to give vitamins to your child if he or she is unable to eat certain foods. Discuss this with your child's healthcare provider.
Your child's healthcare provider may also prescribe an emergency kit.  Be sure to ask your child's healthcare provider about an emergency kit if you don't already have one.
Some children under the supervision of their healthcare provider may be given certain foods after a period of 3 to 6 months. This finds out if the child has outgrown the allergy.  "
Foreign bodies in the aerodigestive tract,"What are foreign bodies in the aerodigestive tract?
Foreign materials, such as food, toys and other small objects can get lodged in the airway or esophagus as a result of inhalation or swallowing. These objects can end up anywhere in the upper airways or the upper digestive tract, including the nose, throat, the esophagus, the trachea (windpipe) or the smaller air passages in the lungs called bronchi. Children under three years of age are particularly prone to such accidents. Close supervision is needed to avoid these accidents. Small toys should not be given to young children (check warning labels). Nuts, sunflower seeds, raw carrots and popcorn kernels are inappropriate foods for young children. Children can die from foreign body aspiration, and prompt treatment is urged. Prevention is the key!
Symptoms
Trouble breathing
Trouble speaking
Drooling, vomiting
Stomach and chest pains
Coughing
Wheezing, especially when only one side of the chest is affected
Cyanosis (bluish skin) due to lack of oxygen
Pneumonia that will not improve
If your child’s airway is partially blocked — marked by difficulty breathing, wheezing and/or bluish skin — call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room, as these may be signs of airway obstruction. If the object is stuck in the nose, the following signs may develop:
Bad smelling mucus or bloody discharge from one side of the nose
Difficulty breathing through the nose
Diagnosis
Diagnosis may include a physical examination, radiographs and bronchoscopy and or esophagoscopy in the operating room.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the blockage. Call your pediatrician and go to the emergency room for evaluation and treatment.
Heimlich maneuver is needed to expel a foreign object caught in the airway with life-threatening airway blockage.
Objects lodged in the airway may be removed under anesthesia in the operating room with a laryngoscope or bronchoscope.
A tube may be inserted into the airway.
Direct opening into the airway (tracheostomy or cricothyrotomy) may be needed.
Swallowed foreign bodies can be removed under anesthesia with an esophagoscope.
When to Call for Help
If you suspect that a foreign object is lodged in your child’s airway, call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room."
Fractures,"What are fractures?
A fracture is a break, usually in a bone. If the broken bone punctures the skin, it is called an open or compound fracture. Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls or sports injuries. In children, most fractures occur in the wrist, the forearm and above the elbow.
Symptoms
Out-of-place or misshapen limb or joint
Swelling, bruising or bleeding
Intense pain
Numbness and tingling
Limited mobility or inability to move a limb"
Gallbladder disease,"What is gallbladder disease?
Gallbladder disease includes inflammation, infection, stones or blockage of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a sac located under the liver. It stores and concentrates bile produced in the liver. Bile aids in the digestion of fat and is released from the gallbladder into the upper small intestine in response to food (especially fats). Types of gallbladder disease include:
Cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder)
Gallstones
Chronic acalculous gallbladder disease (in which the natural movements needed to empty the gallbladder do not work well)
Gangrene or abscesses
Growths of tissue in the gallbladder
Congenital defects of the gallbladder
Sclerosing cholangitis
Tumors of the gallbladder and bile ducts
Symptoms
The mildest and most common symptom of gallbladder disease is intermittent pain called biliary colic. Typically, a patient experiences a steady gripping or gnawing pain in the upper right abdomen near the rib cage, which can be severe and can radiate to the upper back. Some patients with biliary colic experience the pain behind the breastbone. Nausea or vomiting may occur.
Between 1 percent and 3 percent of people with symptomatic gallstones develop inflammation in the gallbladder (acute cholecystitis), which occurs when stones or sludge block the duct. The symptoms are similar to those of biliary colic but are more persistent and severe. They include pain in the upper right abdomen that is severe and constant and may last for days. Pain frequently increases when drawing a breath. About a third of patients have fever and chills. Nausea and vomiting may occur.
Chronic gallbladder disease involves gallstones and mild inflammation. In such cases, the gallbladder may become scarred and stiff. Symptoms of chronic gallbladder disease include complaints of gas, nausea and abdominal discomfort after meals and chronic diarrhea.
Stones lodged in the common bile duct can cause symptoms that are similar to those produced by stones that lodge in the gallbladder, but they may also cause:
Jaundice
Dark urine, lighter stools or both
Rapid heartbeat and abrupt blood pressure drop
Fever, chills, nausea and vomiting, with severe pain in the upper right abdomen
Diagnosis
Blood tests
Ultrasound and other imaging techniques
Treatment
Surgery may be warranted to remove the gallbladder if the patient has gallstones or the gallbladder is not functioning normally. Most of the time this can be performed either laparoscopically (through small incisions) or with robotic-assisted surgery, both as outpatient procedures."
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),"What is GERD?
GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease, is a long-term (chronic) digestive disorder. It happens when stomach contents flow back up (reflux) into the food pipe (esophagus).
GERD is a more serious and long-lasting form of gastroesophageal reflux (GER).
GER is common in babies under 2 years old. Most babies spit up a few times a day during their first 3 months. GER does not cause any problems in babies. In most cases, babies outgrow this by the time they are 12 to 14 months old.
It is also common for children and teens ages 2 to 19 to have GER from time to time. This doesn’t always mean they have GERD.
When GER becomes GERD
Your baby, child, or teen may have GERD if:
Your baby’s symptoms prevent him or her from feeding. These symptoms may include vomiting, gagging, coughing, and trouble breathing.
Your baby has GER for more than 12 to 14 months
Your child or teen has GER more than 2 times a week, for a few months 
What causes GERD?
GERD is often caused by something that affects the LES, the lower esophageal sphincter. The LES is a muscle at the bottom of the food pipe (esophagus). The LES opens to let food into the stomach. It closes to keep food in the stomach. When the LES relaxes too often or for too long, stomach acid flows back into the esophagus. This causes vomiting or heartburn.
Everyone has reflux from time to time. If you have ever burped and had an acid taste in your mouth, you have had reflux. Sometimes the LES relaxes at the wrong times. Often your child will just have a bad taste in his or her mouth. Or your child may have a short, mild feeling of heartburn.
Babies are more likely to have a weak LES. This makes the LES relax when it should stay shut. As food or milk is digesting, the LES opens. It lets the stomach contents go back up to the esophagus. Sometimes the stomach contents go all the way up the esophagus. Then the baby or child vomits. In other cases, the stomach contents only go part of the way up the esophagus. This causes heartburn or breathing problems. In some cases there are no symptoms at all.
Some foods seem to affect the muscle tone of the LES. They let the LES stay open longer than normal. These foods include:
Chocolate
Peppermint
High-fat foods
Other foods cause the stomach to make more acid. These foods include:
Citrus foods
Tomatoes and tomato sauces
Other things that may lead to GERD include:
Being obese
Medicines, including some antihistamines, antidepressants, and pain medicines
Being around secondhand smoke
What are the risk factors for GERD?
GERD is very common during a baby’s first year of life. It often goes away on its own. Your child is more at risk for GERD if he or she has:
Down syndrome
Neuromuscular disorders such as muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy
What are the symptoms of GERD?
Heartburn, or acid indigestion, is the most common symptom of GERD. Heartburn is described as a burning chest pain. It begins behind the breastbone and moves up to the neck and throat. It can last as long as 2 hours. It is often worse after eating. Lying down or bending over after a meal can also lead to heartburn.
Children younger than age 12 will often have different GERD symptoms. They will have a dry cough, asthma symptoms, or trouble swallowing. They won’t have classic heartburn.
Each child may have different symptoms. Common symptoms of GERD include:
Burping or belching
Not eating
Having stomach pain
Being fussy around mealtimes
Vomiting often
Having hiccups
Gagging
Choking
Coughing often
Having coughing fits at night
Other symptoms may include:
Wheezing
Getting colds often
Getting ear infections often
Having a rattling in the chest
Having a sore throat in the morning
Having a sour taste in the mouth
Having bad breath
Loss or decay of tooth enamel
GERD symptoms may seem like other health problems. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is GERD diagnosed?
Your child's healthcare provider will do a physical exam and take a health history. Other tests may include:
Chest X-ray. An X-ray can check for signs that stomach contents have moved into the lungs. This is called aspiration.
Upper GI series or barium swallow. This test looks at the organs of the top part of your child’s digestive system. It checks the food pipe (esophagus), the stomach, and the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). Your child will swallow a metallic fluid called barium. Barium coats the organs so that they can be seen on an X-ray. Then X-rays are taken to check for signs of sores or ulcers, or abnormal blockages.
Endoscopy. This test checks the inside of part of the digestive tract. It uses a small, flexible tube called an endoscope. It has a light and a camera lens at the end. Tissue samples from inside the digestive tract may also be taken for testing.
Esophageal manometry. This test checks the strength of the esophagus muscles. It can see if your child has any problems with reflux or swallowing. A small tube is put into your child’s nostril, then down the throat and into the esophagus. Then it measures the pressure that the esophageal muscles make at rest.
pH monitoring. This test checks the pH or acid level in the esophagus. A thin, plastic tube is placed into your child’s nostril, down the throat, and into the esophagus. The tube has a sensor that measures pH level. The other end of the tube outside your child’s body is attached to a small monitor. This records your child’s pH levels for 24 to 48 hours. During this time your child can go home and do his or her normal activities. You will need to keep a diary of any symptoms your child feels that may be linked to reflux. These include gagging or coughing. You should also keep a record of the time, type of food, and amount of food your child eats. Your child’s pH readings are checked. They are compared to your child’s activity for that time period.
Gastric emptying study. This test is done to see if your child’s stomach sends its contents into the small intestine properly. Delayed gastric emptying can cause reflux into the esophagus
How is GERD treated?
Treatment will depend on your child’s symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
Diet and lifestyle changes
In many cases, diet and lifestyle changes can help to ease GERD. Talk with your child’s healthcare provider about changes you can make. Here are some tips to better manage GERD symptoms.
For babies:
After feedings, hold your baby in an upright position for 30 minutes.
If bottle-feeding, keep the nipple filled with milk. This way your baby won’t swallow too much air while eating. Try different nipples. Find one that lets your baby's mouth make a good seal with the nipple during feeding.
Adding rice cereal to feeding may be helpful for some babies.
Burp your baby a few times during bottle-feeding or breastfeeding. Your child may reflux more often when burping with a full stomach.
For children:
Watch your child's food intake. Limit fried and fatty foods, peppermint, chocolate, drinks with caffeine such as sodas and tea, citrus fruit and juices, and tomato products.
Offer your child smaller portions at mealtimes. Add small snacks between meals if your child is hungry. Don’t let your child overeat. Let your child tell you when he or she is hungry or full.
If your child is overweight, contact your child’s provider to set weight-loss goals.
Serve the evening meal early, at least 3 hours before bedtime.
Other things to try:
Ask your child's provider to review your child’s medicines. Some may irritate the lining of the stomach or esophagus.
Don’t let your child lie down or go to bed right after a meal.
Always check with your baby’s provider before raising the head of the crib if he or she has been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux. This is for safety reasons and to reduce the risk for SIDS and other sleep-related infant deaths. 
Medicines and other treatments
Your child’s healthcare provider may also recommend other options.
Medicines. Your child's provider may prescribe medicines to help with reflux. There are medicines that help reduce the amount of acid the stomach makes. This reduces the heartburn linked to reflux. These medicines may include:
H2-blockers. These reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes by blocking the hormone histamine. Histamine helps to make acid.
Proton pump inhibitors. These help keep your stomach from making acid. They do this by stopping the stomach's acid pump from working.
The provider may prescribe another type of medicine that helps the stomach empty faster. If food doesn’t stay in the stomach as long as normal, reflex may be less likely to occur.  
Calorie supplements. Some babies with reflux can’t gain weight because they vomit often. If this is the case, your child's healthcare provider may suggest:
Adding rice cereal to baby formula
Giving your baby more calories by adding a prescribed supplement
Changing formula to milk- or soy-free formula if your baby may have an allergy
Tube feedings. In some cases tube feedings may be recommended. Some babies with reflux have other conditions that make them tired. These include congenital heart disease or being born too early (premature). These babies often get sleepy after they eat or drink a little. Other babies vomit after having a normal amount of formula. These babies do better if they are constantly fed a small amount of milk. In both of these cases, tube feedings may be suggested. Formula or breastmilk is given through a tube that is placed in the nose. This is called a nasogastric tube. The tube is then put through the food pipe or esophagus, and into the stomach. Your baby can have a tube feeding in addition to a bottle feeding. Or a tube feeding may be done instead of a bottle feeding. There are also tubes that can be used to go around, or bypass, the stomach. These are called nasoduodenal tubes.
Surgery. In severe cases of reflux, surgery called fundoplication may be done. Your baby’s provider may recommend this option if your child is not gaining weight because of vomiting, has frequent breathing problems, or has severe irritation in the esophagus. This is often done as a laparoscopic surgery. This method has less pain and a faster recovery time. Small cuts or incisions are made in your child’s belly. A small tube with a camera on the end is placed into one of the incisions to look inside. The surgical tools are put through the other incisions. The surgeon looks at a video screen to see the stomach and other organs. The top part of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus. This creates a tight band. This strengthens the LES and greatly decreases reflux.
What are the complications of GERD?
Some babies and children who have GERD may not vomit. But their stomach contents may still move up the food pipe (esophagus) and spill over into the windpipe (trachea). This can cause asthma or pneumonia.
The vomiting that affects many babies and children with GERD can cause problems with weight gain and poor nutrition. Over time, when stomach acid backs up into the esophagus, it can also lead to:
Inflammation of the esophagus, called esophagitis
Sores or ulcers in the esophagus, which can be painful and may bleed
A lack of red blood cells, from bleeding sores (anemia)
Adults may also have long-term problems from inflammation of the esophagus. These include:
Narrowing, or stricture, of the esophagus
Barrett’s esophagus, a condition where there are abnormal cells in the esophageal lining
Living with GERD
Many babies who vomit outgrow it by the time they are about 1 year old. This happens as the LES gets stronger. For other children, taking medicines and making lifestyle and diet changes can reduce reflux, vomiting, and heartburn.
When should I call my child's healthcare provider?
Call you child's healthcare provider if your baby or child:
Has reflux and is not gaining weight
Has signs of asthma or pneumonia. These include coughing, wheezing, or trouble breathing.
Key points about GERD
GERD is a long-term (chronic) digestive disorder.
It happens when stomach contents come back up into the food pipe (esophagus).
Heartburn or acid indigestion is the most common symptom of GERD.
Vomiting can cause problems with weight gain and poor nutrition.
In many cases, GERD can be eased by diet and lifestyle changes.
Sometimes medicines, tube feedings, or surgery may be needed.
Next steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Gastrointestinal bleeding or blood in the stool,"What is gastrointestinal bleeding or blood in the stool?
The signs of bleeding in the digestive tract depend upon the site and severity of bleeding. If blood is coming from the rectum or the lower colon, bright red blood will coat or mix with the stool. The cause of bleeding may not be serious, but locating the source of bleeding is important. The digestive or gastrointestinal (GI) tract includes the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine or colon, rectum and anus. Bleeding can come from one or more of these areas — from a small area like an ulcer on the lining of the stomach or from a large surface, such as an inflammation of the colon. Bleeding can sometimes occur without the person noticing it. This type of bleeding is called occult or hidden. Fortunately, simple tests can detect occult blood in the stool.
Symptoms
Symptoms like changes in bowel habits, stool color (to black or red) and consistency and the presence of pain or tenderness may tell the doctor which area of the GI tract is affected. Because the intake of iron, bismuth or foods like beets can give the stool the same appearance as bleeding from the digestive tract, a doctor must test the stool for blood before offering a diagnosis.
Other symptoms:
Bright red blood coating the stool
Dark blood mixed with the stool
Black or tarry stool
Bright red blood in vomit
Coffee grounds appearance of vomit
Diagnosis
The site of the bleeding must be located. A complete history and physical examination are essential. A blood count will indicate whether the patient is anemic and also will give an idea of the extent of the bleeding and how chronic it may be.
Endoscopy
Endoscopy is a common diagnostic technique that allows direct viewing of the bleeding site. Because the endoscope can detect lesions and confirm the presence or absence of bleeding, doctors often choose this method to diagnose patients with acute bleeding. In many cases, the doctor can use the endoscope to treat the cause of bleeding as well. The endoscope is a flexible instrument that can be inserted through the mouth or rectum. The instrument allows the doctor to see into the esophagus, stomach, duodenum (esophagoduodenoscopy), colon (colonoscopy) and rectum (sigmoidoscopy); to collect small samples of tissue (biopsies); to take photographs; and to stop the bleeding. Small bowel endoscopy, or enteroscopy, is a procedure using a long endoscope. This endoscope may be used to localize unidentified sources of bleeding in the small intestine.
Other procedures
Several other methods are available to locate the source of bleeding. Barium X-rays, in general, are less accurate than endoscopy in locating bleeding sites. Some drawbacks of barium X-rays are that they may interfere with other diagnostic techniques if used for detecting acute bleeding, they expose the patient to X-rays and they do not offer the capabilities of biopsy or treatment. Another type of X-ray is a CT scan. Angiography is a technique that uses dye to highlight blood vessels. This procedure is most useful in situations when the patient is bleeding acutely, so that dye leaks out of the blood vessel and identifies the site of bleeding. In selected situations, angiography allows injection of medicine into arteries that may stop the bleeding.
Treatment
Endoscopy is the primary diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for most causes of GI bleeding. Active bleeding from the upper GI tract can often be controlled by injecting chemicals directly into a bleeding site with a needle introduced through the endoscope. A physician can also cauterize, or heat treat, a bleeding site and surrounding tissue with a heater probe or electrocoagulation device passed through the endoscope. Laser therapy is useful in certain specialized situations.
Once bleeding is controlled, medication is often prescribed to prevent recurrence of bleeding. Medication is useful primarily for H. pylori, esophagitis, ulcers, infections and irritable bowel disease. Medical treatment of ulcers, including the elimination of H. pylori, to ensure healing and maintenance therapy to prevent ulcer recurrence can also lessen the chance of recurrent bleeding. Removal of polyps with an endoscope can control bleeding from colon polyps. Removal of hemorrhoids by banding or various heat or electrical devices is effective in patients who suffer hemorrhoidal bleeding on a recurrent basis. Endoscopic injection or cautery can be used to treat bleeding sites throughout the lower intestinal tract. Endoscopic techniques do not always control bleeding. Sometimes angiography may be used. However, surgery is often needed to control active, severe or recurrent bleeding when endoscopy is not successful."
Gastroschisis,"What is gastroschisis?
Gastroschisis is a birth defect in which an infant's intestines stick out of the body through a defect on one side of the umbilical cord. The child's intestines can be easily seen. The condition is similar to an omphalocele, a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs stick out of the belly button area. Other associated congenital defects are rare in patients with gastroschisis.
Symptoms
Lump in the abdomen
Intestine sticks through the abdominal wall near the umbilical cord
Problems with movement and absorption in the gut due to the unprotected intestine being exposed to irritating amniotic fluid
Diagnosis
Physical examination of the infant is sufficient for the health care provider to diagnose gastroschisis. The mother may have shown signs indicating excessive amniotic fluid, a condition called polyhydramnios. Prenatal ultrasonography often identifies gastroschisis.
Treatment
If identified before birth, mothers with gastroschisis need special monitoring to make sure the unborn baby remains and healthy. Plans should be made for careful delivery and immediate management of the problem after birth.
The treatment for gastroschisis is surgery. A surgeon will put the bowel back into the abdomen and close the defect, if possible. If the abdominal cavity is too small, a mesh sack is stitched around the borders of the defect and the edges of the defect are pulled up. Over time, the herniated intestine falls back into the abdominal cavity, and the defect can be closed.
Other treatments for the baby include nutrients by IV and antibiotics to prevent infection. The baby's temperature must be carefully controlled, since the exposed intestine allows a lot of body heat to escape.
Prognosis
Likelihood of recovery is good if the abdominal cavity is relatively large enough. A very small abdominal cavity may result in complications requiring additional surgery."
Gilbert’s syndrome,"What is Gilbert's syndrome?
Gilbert's syndrome is a benign hereditary disease that affects the way bilirubin is processed in the liver and causes jaundice.
Symptoms
Yellowing of the skin and of the whites of the eyes
Fatigue
Diagnosis
A blood test can show changes that occur with Gilbert’s syndrome.
Treatment
There is no treatment. However, anyone with jaundice should contact their doctor."
Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an autoimmune disorder. An autoimmune disorder occurs when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy tissue. This condition causes inflammation, swelling, and irritation in blood vessels and other tissues.
This inflammation reduces or stops the flow of blood to organs in the body. The condition mostly affects the respiratory system. This includes the sinuses, nose, windpipe, and lungs. It can also affect the kidneys. But it can damage any organ in the body.
What causes granulomatosis with polyangiitis?
GPA is not common. It can start at any age. Doctors don't know what causes it.
What are the symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis?
Most people with GPA first have vague symptoms that may include:
Tiredness or exhaustion
Joint pain
Upper respiratory symptoms that don’t respond to treatments for allergies or colds:
Runny nose
Bloody discharge
Sinus pain
Congestion
Blockage of the eustachian tubes in the ears
Cough
Cough that produces blood
Shortness of breath
Eye infections, redness, burning, or pain
Weakness
Skin sores or ulcers
Hoarseness
Fever
Night sweats
How is granulomatosis with polyangiitis diagnosed?
To diagnose GPA, your healthcare provider may do the following:
Take your health history
Do a physical exam
Review of your symptoms
Order blood tests
Order an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) blood test
Order imaging tests, such as chest X-rays or CT scans of the lungs or sinus
Do a biopsy from an affected organ to see if the condition is present
Order urine tests
Some of these tests can help rule out other causes of your symptoms. They may not confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy is the only way to know for sure if it’s GPA.
How is granulomatosis with polyangiitis treated?
Most people with GPA can be treated. But the medicines used to treat this condition could have side effects of their own. Be sure to talk about these side effects with your healthcare provider.
These are common medicines used in treatment:
Corticosteroids. This steroid helps reduce inflammation. Long-term steroid use can affect your bone health, so your healthcare provider may also watch and treat changes in your bone density.
Rituximab. This is an antibody against certain immune cells (B-cells). These cells help cause the autoimmune state in GPA.
Cyclophosphamide. This is used to treat active GPA.
This medicine may be given to keep symptoms in remission for 1 to 2 years.
This is an alternative to methotrexate.
This medicine may be given along with prednisone to treat GPA and bring about remission.
Antibiotics. Certain infections are more common among people with this condition. Antibiotics may be given to treat or prevent infection.
GPA may come back even after successful treatment. Continue to follow up with your healthcare provider, even when you are in remission.
What are the possible complications of granulomatosis with polyangiitis?
Ongoing GPA can cause:
Collapse of cartilage in the nose
Infections of sinuses and ears
Hearing loss
Kidney damage
Kidney failure
Death
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call your healthcare provider if you have the symptoms listed above. This is especially true if you have tried over-the-counter treatments that seem appropriate, such as allergy medicines, with no success.
Always call your healthcare provider if you have changes in vision. Call if you have a cough that produces bloody mucus. These may be symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) or another serious health problem.
Key points about granulomatosis with polyangiitis
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an autoimmune disorder that causes swelling and irritation in blood vessels and other tissues. It is uncommon.
Doctors don't know what causes it.
Most people with GPA first report vague symptoms.
Biopsy is the only way to know for sure if it’s GPA.
Most people with GPA will find relief by taking strong medicines.
GGPA may come back even after successful treatment.
Ongoing GPA can have serious complications.
Continue to follow up with your healthcare provider, even when you are in remission."
Growth hormone deficiency,"What is growth hormone deficiency?
Growth hormone deficiency (GHD), also known as dwarfism or pituitary dwarfism, is a condition caused by insufficient amounts of growth hormone in the body. Children with GHD have abnormally short stature with normal body proportions. GHD can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later (acquired). The condition occurs if the pituitary gland makes too little growth hormone. It can be also the result of genetic defects, severe brain injury or being born without a pituitary gland. In some cases, there is no clear cause identified. Sometimes, GHD can be associated with lower levels of other hormones, such as vasopressin (which controls water production in the body), gonadotropins (which controls the production of male and female sex hormones), thyrotropins (which control the production of thyroid hormones) or adrenocorticotrophic hormone (which controls the adrenal gland and related hormones). 
Symptoms
Slow growth or absence of growth
Short stature (below the fifth percentile compared to other children of the same age and sex)
Absent or delayed sexual development during puberty 
Headaches
Symptoms of other pituitary hormone deficiencies that may co-exist with growth hormone deficiency:
Absent or delayed sexual development during puberty
Increased urination and amount of urine
Excessive thirst
Facial abnormalities can be present in a small group of children with GHD, typically caused by pituitary defects.
Diagnosis
A physical exam and measurement of height, weight, arms and leg lengths are the first steps to diagnosis, in addition to thorough medical history. Blood tests to measure the levels of growth hormone in the body as well as the levels of other hormones. Imaging tests including X-rays and MRI of the head may be helpful in narrowing down the underlying disorder causing GHD by revealing abnormalities of the hypothalamus or the pituitary glands. 
Treatment
Some cases of GHD can be treated with the use of synthetic growth hormone under the supervision of a pediatric endocrinologist. If other hormone deficiencies exist, other hormones can be given in addition to synthetic growth hormone."
Head injury,"What is a head injury?
Head injuries are one of the most common causes of disability and death in children. The injury can be as mild as a bump, bruise (contusion), or cut on the head, or can be moderate to severe in nature due to a concussion, deep cut or open wound, fractured skull bone(s), or from internal bleeding and damage to the brain.
A head injury is a broad term that describes a vast array of injuries that occur to the scalp, skull, brain, and underlying tissue and blood vessels in the child's head. Head injuries are also commonly referred to as brain injury, or traumatic brain injury (TBI), depending on the extent of the head trauma.
What is a concussion?
A concussion is an injury to the head area that may cause instant loss of awareness or alertness for a few minutes up to a few hours after the traumatic event. Some concussions are mild and brief, and the person or untrained observer may not recognize that a concussion has occurred.
What is a contusion?
A contusion is a bruise to the brain. A contusion causes bleeding and swelling inside of the brain around the area where the head was struck, or sometimes on the opposite side of the head due to the brain hitting the skull.
What is a skull fracture?
A skull fracture is a break in the skull bone. There are 4 major types of skull fractures:
Linear skull fractures. In a linear fracture, there is a break in the bone, but it does not move the bone. In many instances, these children can be observed in the emergency department or the hospital for a brief amount of time, and can usually resume normal activities in a few days. No interventions are usually necessary.
Depressed skull fractures. This type of fracture may be seen with or without a cut in the scalp. In this fracture, part of the skull is actually sunken in from the trauma. If the inner part of the skull is pressed against the brain, this type of skull fracture requires surgical intervention to help correct the deformity.
Diastatic skull fractures. These are fractures that occur along the suture lines in the skull. The sutures are the areas between the bones in the head that fuse with the growth of the child. In this type of fracture, the normal suture lines are widened. These fractures are more often seen in newborns and infants.
Basilar skull fracture. This can be a serious type of skull fracture, and involves a break in the bone at the base of the skull. Children with this type of fracture frequently have bruises around their eyes and a bruise behind their ear. They may also have clear fluid draining from their nose or ears due to a tear in part of the covering of the brain. These children sometimes require close observation in the hospital.
What causes a head injury?
There are many causes of head injury in children. The more common injuries are sports injuries, falls, motor vehicle accidents (where the child is either riding as a passenger in the car or is struck as a pedestrian), or a result of child abuse.
The risk of head injury is high in the adolescent population and is twice as frequent in males than in females. Studies show that head injuries are more common in the spring and summer months when children are usually very active in outdoor activities such as riding bicycles, in-line skating, or skateboarding. The most common time associated with head injuries is late in the afternoon to early evening hours, and on weekends. Although usually not life threatening, head injury that occurs in competitive sports such as football, soccer, hockey, and basketball can result in concussion and postconcussive syndromes.
What causes bruising and internal damage to the brain?
When there is a direct blow to the head, shaking of the child (as seen in many cases of child abuse), or a whiplash-type injury (as seen in motor vehicle accidents), the bruising of the brain and the damage to the internal tissue and blood vessels is due to a mechanism called coup-countrecoup. A bruise directly related to trauma, at the site of impact, is called a coup lesion (pronounced COO). As the brain jolts backwards, it can hit the skull on the opposite side and cause a bruise called a countrecoup lesion. The jarring of the brain against the sides of the skull can cause tearing of the internal lining, tissues, and blood vessels that may cause internal bleeding, bruising, or swelling of the brain.
What are the symptoms of a head injury?
The following are the most common symptoms of a head injury. The child may have varying degrees of symptoms associated with the severity of the head injury. The symptoms of a mild head injury may include:
Mild head injury:
Raised, swollen area from a bump or a bruise
Small, superficial (shallow) cut in the scalp
Headache
Sensitivity to noise and light
Irritability
Confusion
Lightheadedness and/or dizziness
Problems with balance
Nausea
Problems with memory and/or concentration
Change in sleep patterns
Blurred vision
""Tired"" eyes
Ringing in the ears (tinnitus)
Alteration in taste
Fatigue or lethargy
Moderate to severe head injury (that requires immediate medical attention)--symptoms may include any of the above plus: 
Loss of consciousness
Severe headache that does not go away
Repeated nausea and vomiting
Loss of short term memory, such as difficulty remembering the events that led right up to and through the traumatic event
Slurred speech
Difficulty with walking
Weakness in one side or area of the body
Sweating
Pale in color
Seizures or convulsions
Behavior changes including irritable
Blood or clear fluid draining from the ears or nose
One pupil (dark area in the center of the eye) looks larger than the other eye
Deep cut or laceration in the scalp
Open wound in the head
Foreign object penetrating the head
Coma (a state of unconsciousness from which a person cannot be awakened; responds only minimally, if at all, to stimuli; and exhibits no voluntary activities)
Vegetative state (a condition of brain damage in which a person has lost his thinking abilities and awareness of his surroundings, but retains some basic functions, such as breathing and blood circulation)
Locked-in syndrome (a neurological condition in which a person is conscious and can think and reason, but cannot speak or move)
How are head injuries diagnosed?
The full extent of the problem may not be completely understood right after the injury, but may be revealed with a comprehensive medical evaluation and diagnostic testing. The diagnosis of a head injury is made with a physical exam and diagnostic tests. During the exam, the doctor obtains a complete medical history of the child and family and asks how the injury occurred. Trauma to the head can cause neurological problems and may require further medical follow up.
Diagnostic tests may include:
Blood tests
X-ray. A diagnostic test that uses invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs onto film.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of large magnets, radiofrequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body.
Computed tomography scan (also called a CT or CAT scan). A diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of X-rays and computer technology to produce horizontal, or axial, images (often called slices) of the body. A CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays. Although an X-ray is useful when looking for a skull fracture, most skull fractures can also be detected by a CT scan, which also produces images of the brain. If a brain injury is suspected, a CT scan alone may be used to reduce the amount of radiation the patient receives,
Electroencephalogram (EEG). A procedure that records the brain's continuous, electrical activity by means of electrodes attached to the scalp.
Treatment of a head injury
Your child’s health care provider will figure out the best treatment based on:
How old child is
His or her overall health and medical history
How sick he or she is
How well your child can handle specific medications, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Depending on the severity of the injury, treatment may include:
Ice
Rest
Topical antibiotic ointment and adhesive bandage
Observation
Immediate medical attention
Stitches
Hospitalization for observation
Moderate sedation or assistance with breathing that would require being placed on a breathing machine, also called a mechanical ventilator or mechanical respirator
Diagnostic tests
Surgery
Referral to a traumatic brain injury specialist for postconcussive syndrome
Treatment is individualized depending on the extent of the condition and the presence of other injuries. If your child has a head injury, he or she may require monitoring for increased intracranial pressure (pressure inside the skull). Head injury may cause the brain to swell. Since the brain is covered by the skull, there is only a small amount of room for it to swell. This causes pressure inside the skull to increase, which can lead to brain damage.
How is ICP monitored?
Intracranial pressure is measured in two ways. One way is to place a small hollow tube (catheter) into the fluid-filled space in the brain (ventricle). Other times, a small hollow device (bolt) is placed through the skull into the space just between the skull and the brain. Both devices are inserted by the doctor either in the intensive care unit or in the operating room. The ICP device is then attached to a monitor that gives a constant reading of the pressure inside the skull. If the pressure goes up, it can be treated right away. While the ICP device is in place your child will be given medicine to stay comfortable. When the swelling has gone down and there is little chance of more swelling, the device will be removed.
Lifelong considerations for a child with a head injury
The key is to promote a safe playing environment for children and to prevent head injuries from occurring. The use of seat belts when riding in the car and helmets (when worn properly) for activities, such as bicycle riding, in-line skating, and skateboarding may protect the head from sustaining severe injuries.
Children who suffer a severe brain injury may lose part(s) of muscle, speech, vision, hearing, or taste function depending on the area of brain damage. Long- or short-term changes in personality or behavior may also occur. These children require lifelong medical and rehabilitative (physical, occupational, or speech therapy) management.
The extent of the child's recovery depends on the type of brain injury and other medical problems that may be present. It is important to focus on maximizing the child's capabilities at home and in the community. Positive reinforcement will encourage the child to strengthen his or her self-esteem and promote independence."
Headache,"What is a headache?
A headache is pain or discomfort in the head or face area. Headaches can be single or recurrent in nature, and localized to one or more areas of the head and face.
What causes a headache?
The exact cause of headaches is not completely understood. It is thought that many headaches are the result of tight muscles and dilated, or expanded, blood vessels in the head. Although migraine headaches were previously thought to be due to dilated blood vessels in the brain, newer theories suggest that changes in brain chemicals or electrical signaling may be involved. Other headaches may be caused by an alteration in the communication between parts of the nervous system that relay information about pain, coming from the area of the head, face, and neck. Lack of sleep and poor sleep quality are often the cause of chronic headaches. Occasionally, there is an actual problem in the brain, such as a tumor or malformation of the brain, although this is rare.
The way a child exhibits a headache may be related to many factors, such as genetics, hormones, stress, diet, medications, and dehydration. Recurrent headaches of any type can cause school problems, behavioral problems, and/or depression.
What are the different types of headaches?
There are many different ways to classify headaches. One method divides headaches into two categories:
Primary headaches
These are usually caused by tight muscles, dilated blood vessels, alterations in communication between parts of the nervous system, or inflammation of the structures in the brain and are not linked to another medical condition. Types of primary headaches include the following:
Migraines
Migraines may start early in childhood. It is estimated that nearly 20 percent of teens experience migraine headache. The average age of onset is 7 years of age for boys and 10 years of age for girls. There is often a family history of migraines. Some females may have migraines that correlate with their menstrual periods. While every child may experience symptoms differently, the following are the most common symptoms of a migraine:
Pain on one or both sides of the head (some younger children may complain of pain all over)
Pain may be throbbing or pounding in quality (although young children may not be able to describe their pain)
Sensitivity to light or sound
Nausea and/or vomiting
Abdominal discomfort
Sweating
Child may become quiet or pale
Some children have an aura before the migraine, such as a sense of flashing lights, a change in vision, or funny smells
Tension headaches
Tension headaches are the most common type of headache. Stress and mental or emotional conflict are often factors in triggering pain related to tension headaches. While every child may experience symptoms differently, the following are the most common symptoms of a tension headache:
Slow onset of the headache
Head usually hurts on both sides
Pain is dull or feels like a band around the head
Pain may involve the posterior (back) part of the head or neck
Pain is mild to moderate, but not severe
Change in the child's sleep habits
Children with tension headaches typically do not experience nausea, vomiting, or light sensitivity.
Cluster headaches
Cluster headaches usually start in children older than 10 years of age, and are more common in adolescent males. They are much less frequent than migraine or tension headaches. Cluster headaches usually occur in a series that may last weeks or months, and this series of headaches may return every year or two. While every child may experience symptoms differently, the following are the most common symptoms of a cluster headache:
Severe pain on one side of the head, usually behind one eye
The eye that is affected may have a droopy lid, small pupil, or redness and swelling of the eyelid
Runny nose or congestion
Swelling of the forehead
Secondary headaches
These are from an organic cause in the brain (problems in the structure of the brain) due to another health condition or disease, and are the least common type of headaches.
What types of headache are associated with serious illness?
The child may have varying degrees of symptoms associated with the severity of the headache depending on the type of headache. Some headaches may be more serious. Symptoms that may suggest a more serious underlying cause of the headache may include the following:
A very young child with a headache
A child that is awakened by the pain of a headache
Headaches that start very early in the morning
Pain that is worsened by strain, such as a cough or a sneeze
Recurrent episodes of vomiting without nausea or other signs of a stomach virus
Sudden onset of pain and the ""worst headache"" ever
Headache that is becoming more severe or continuous
Personality changes that have occurred as the headache syndrome evolved
Changes in vision
Weakness in the arms or legs, or balance problems
Seizures or epilepsy
The symptoms of a headache may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your child's doctor for a diagnosis.
How are headaches diagnosed?
The full extent of the problem may not be completely understood immediately, but may be revealed with a comprehensive medical evaluation and diagnostic testing. The diagnosis of a headache is made with a careful history and physical examination and diagnostic tests. During the examination, the doctor obtains a complete medical history of the child and family.
Questions commonly asked during the examination may include the following:
When do headaches occurs?
What is the location of the headache?
What do the headaches feel like?
How long do the headaches last?
Have there been changes in walking and behavior patterns, or personality?
Do changes in positioning or sitting-up cause the headache?
Is your child having trouble sleeping?
Does your child have a history of emotional stress?
Is there a history of trauma to your child's head or face?
If the history is consistent with migraine or tension type headaches and the neurological exam is normal, no further diagnostic testing may be necessary.
Other diagnostic tests may include:
Blood tests. These may include a complete blood count, levels or iron, levels of ferritin, and thyroid function tests.
MRI. A diagnostic procedure that uses a combination of large magnets, radiofrequencies, and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body.
CT scan. A diagnostic imaging procedure that uses a combination of X-rays and computer technology to produce horizontal, or axial, images (often called slices) of the body. A CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays.
Polysomnogram. This is a painless test that is usually done in a sleep lab. It involves recording breathing and muscle movements. A polysomnogram is generally done if there is a suggestion of a sleep disorder, such as sleep apnea or another sleep related problem.
Treatment for headaches
Specific treatment for headaches will be determined by your child's doctor based on:
Your child's age, overall health, and medical history
Extent of the headaches
Type of headaches
Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
Your opinion or preference
The ultimate goal of treatment is to stop the headache from occurring. Medical management relies on the proper identification of the type of headache and may include:
Rest in a quiet, dark environment
Medications, as recommended by your child's doctor
Stress management
Avoid known triggers, such as certain foods and beverages, lack of sleep, and fasting
Diet changes
Exercise
Migraine headaches may require specific medication management including:
Abortive medicines. Medicines, prescribed by your child's doctor, that act on specific receptors in blood vessels in the head and can stop a headache in progress.
Rescue medicines. Medicines purchased over-the-counter, such as analgesics (pain relievers), to stop the headache.
Preventive medicines. Medicines, prescribed by your child's doctor, that are taken daily to reduce the onset of severe migraine headaches.
Some headaches may require immediate medical attention including hospitalization for observation, diagnostic testing, or even surgery. Treatment is individualized depending on the extent of the underlying condition that is causing the child's headache. The extent of the child's recovery is individualized depending on the type of headache and other medical problems that may be present."
Hearing loss,"What is hearing loss?
Hearing loss in children can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in childhood (acquired). Congenital hearing loss can be hereditary (genetic) or caused by infections during pregnancy, including infection with cytomegalovirus or rubella. Hearing loss is more common in babies who are in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Hearing loss can be an isolated condition or a feature of a syndrome that causes additional symptoms. Genetic testing can help determine the cause of hearing loss in some cases. Acquired hearing loss can be caused by infectious diseases, such as meningitis or recurrent ear infections, as well as trauma and certain medications.
Depending on its cause and origin, the hearing loss can be:
Sensorineural, a permanent type of hearing loss which occurs when the inner ear (cochlea) or the auditory nerve is damaged or malformed
Conductive, which occurs when the sound can’t travel through the ear because of earwax build-up, a foreign body lodged somewhere in the ear, build-up of fluid or a punctured eardrum (Conductive hearing losses may be treated in some cases with medicine or surgery.)
Hearing loss is categorized as mild, moderate, severe or profound depending on its severity.
Symptoms
Reduced hearing, such as inability to hear faint sounds
Failure to respond to sound
Delay of language and speech development in young children
Unclear speech"
Helicobacter pylori gastritis,"What is H. pylori (Helicobacter pylori)?
H. pylori (Heliobacter pylori, pronounced Hel-ee-koh-BAK-ter Pie-LORE-ee) is a type of bacteria that infects your stomach.
It can damage the tissue in your stomach and the first part of your small intestine (the duodenum). This can cause redness and soreness (inflammation). In some cases it can also cause painful sores called peptic ulcers in your upper digestive tract.
H. pylori is common. Many people have it. Most people who have it won’t get ulcers or show any symptoms. But it is a main cause of ulcers.
H. pylori attacks the lining that protects your stomach. The bacteria makes an enzyme called urease. This enzyme makes your stomach acids less acidic (neutralizes them). This weakens your stomach’s lining.
Your stomach cells then have greater risk of being hurt by acid and pepsin, strong digestive fluids. That can lead to sores or ulcers in your stomach or duodenum.
The H. pylori bacteria can also stick to stomach cells. Your stomach can’t protect itself very well. The area gets red and swollen (inflamed).
H. pylori can also get the stomach to make more acid. Health experts don’t fully understand how.
What causes H. pylori infection?
Health experts don’t know for sure how H. pylori infection is spread. They believe the germs can be passed from person to person by mouth, such as by kissing.
It may also be passed by having contact with vomit or stool. This may happen if you:
Eat food that was not cleaned or cooked in a safe way
Drink water that is infected with the bacteria
Who is at risk for H. pylori infection?
You may be at greater risk for H. pylori infection because of:
Your age. Over half the people in the U.S. with the bacteria are over 50 years old.
Your race or ethnicity. Almost half of all African Americans have the bacteria. For people who come to the U.S. from developing countries, at least 50% of Latinos and 50% of people from Eastern Europe have H. pylori.
Most people first get the bacteria when they are children, but adults can get it too.
What are the symptoms of H. pylori?
Most people have the bacteria for years without knowing it because they don’t have any symptoms. Experts don’t know why.
You may have redness and swelling (inflammation) in your stomach lining. This is called gastritis.  
You may get sores or peptic ulcers in your stomach or the first part of your small intestine (duodenum). Ulcer symptoms may include belly or abdominal pain, which can:
Be a dull pain that doesn’t go away
Happen 2 to 3 hours after you eat
Come and go for several days or weeks
Happen in the middle of the night when your stomach is empty
Go away when you eat or take medicines that reduce your stomach acid level (antacids)
Other symptoms of an ulcer may include:
Weight loss
Not feeling hungry
Swelling or bloating
Burping
Having an upset stomach or nausea
Vomiting
The symptoms of ulcers may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider to be sure.
How is H. pylori diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will look at your past health and give you a physical exam. He or she may also use other tests, including:
Blood tests. These check for infection-fighting cells (antibodies) that mean you have the bacteria.
Stool culture. This looks for any abnormal bacteria in your digestive tract that may cause diarrhea and other problems. A small stool sample is collected and sent to a lab. In 2 or 3 days, the test will show if you have any abnormal bacteria.
Breath tests. These can check if there is any carbon after you swallow a urea pill that has carbon molecules. If carbon is found that means that H. pylori has made the enzyme urease. This enzyme makes your stomach acids less acidic (neutralizes them). It weakens your stomach’s mucous lining.
Upper endoscopy, also called EGD (esophagogastroduodenoscopy). This test looks at the lining of your food pipe (esophagus), stomach, and duodenum (the first part of your small intestine). It uses a thin, lighted tube or endoscope. The tube has a camera at one end. The tube is put into your mouth and throat. Then it goes down into your esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Your healthcare provider can see the inside of these organs. A small tissue sample (biopsy) is taken if needed. The tissue sample can show if you have the enzyme urease. It can also check the bacteria that is there.
How is H. pylori treated?
Your healthcare provider will create a care plan for you based on:
Your age, overall health, and past health
How serious your case is
How well you handle certain medicines, treatments, or therapies
If your condition is expected to get worse
What you would like to do
Your healthcare provider may have you take medicine that kills bacteria (antibiotics).
Other medicines may include:
H2-blockers. These are used to reduce the amount of acid in your stomach by blocking the hormone histamine. Histamine helps to make acid.
Proton pump inhibitors. These help to keep your stomach from making acid. They do this by stopping the stomach's acid pump from working.
Stomach-lining protectors. These medicines protect your stomach lining from acid and help kill bacteria.
Helicobacter Pylori in Children
H. pylori is a very common cause of peptic ulcers and gastritis in adults, but it can and does occur in children too.
Call your pediatrician if your child has any symptoms suggestive of gastritis. If your child has been diagnosed with an ulcer or H. pylori gastritis, call a doctor immediately if the following occur as they may be symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding or ulcer perforation:
Sudden, sharp abdominal pain
Blood in the stool or black feces
Bloody vomit or vomit that looks like coffee grounds
What are the complications of H. pylori?
If you are infected with the bacteria you can get a painful sore called a peptic ulcer. These sores form in your upper digestive tract.
A very bad ulcer can wear away your stomach lining. It can also cause problems such as:
Bleeding when a blood vessel is worn away
A hole or perforation in your stomach wall
Blockage when the ulcer is in a spot that blocks food from leaving your stomach
H. pylori can also lead to stomach cancer.
What can I do to prevent H. pylori?
Health experts don’t know for sure how the bacteria passes from person to person. But having good health habits (hygiene) can help keep you safe. These habits include:
Washing your hands with soap and water. It is very important to do this after using the bathroom and before eating.
Making sure all food you eat has been cleaned and cooked safely
Making sure that your drinking water is safe and clean
Living with H. pylori
Once you know for sure that you have H. pylori, follow up with your healthcare provider. He or she will do some tests to make sure the bacteria has been removed.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call your healthcare provider if your symptoms get worse or you have new symptoms. Call right away if you have symptoms such as bloody vomit, blood in your stools, or black, tarry-looking stools.
Key points
H. pylori is a type of bacteria that infects your stomach.
It attacks your stomach and the first part of your small intestine (duodenum). This can cause redness and swelling (inflammation).
Many people with the bacteria won’t have any symptoms.

Hemangiomas,"What is a hemangioma?
A hemangioma is a type of birthmark and vascular abnormality and is the most common benign (noncancerous) tumor of the skin. Port-wine stains, strawberry hemangiomas and salmon patches are all hemangiomas. 
Symptoms
While they may be very faint or invisible at birth, most hemangiomas grow rapidly after birth. Over time, they become smaller and lighter in color. The process of involution may take several years. 
Diagnosis
A clinical evaluation is required for diagnosis. 
Treatment
Treatment for hemangiomas depends upon their size, location and severity. Treatment is usually not recommended for small, noninvasive hemangiomas, as they will become smaller on their own. Hemangiomas that cause bleeding problems, feeding or breathing difficulties, growth disturbances or impairment of vision may require medical or surgical intervention.
Treatment may include:
Steroid medications
Embolization of the blood vessels (injection of material into the blood vessels to block the blood inflow)
Laser or surgical removal"
Hematuria,"What is blood in the urine?
Blood in the urine means there are red blood cells (RBCs) in the urine. Often, the urine looks normal to the naked eye. But when checked under a microscope, it contains a high number of red blood cells. In some cases, the urine is pink, red, or the color of tea, which you can see without a microscope.
What causes blood in the urine?
Most of the causes of blood in the urine are not serious. For example, heavy exercise may cause blood in the urine, which often goes away in a day.
Other, more serious causes include:
Cancer
Kidney infection or disease
Urinary tract infection (UTI)
Enlarged prostate (men only)
Kidney or bladder stones
Certain diseases (like sickle cell anemia and cystic kidney disease)
Injury to the kidneys
Some medications cause blood in the urine. And many people have it without having any other related problems.
What are the symptoms of blood in the urine?
There not be enough blood in the urine to change the color, but in severe cases, the urine may look pink, red, or tea colored.
How is blood in the urine diagnosed?
Your doctor will review your medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include:
Urinalysis. Urine is tested for various cells and chemicals, such as red and white blood cells, germs, or too much protein.
Blood tests. Blood is checked for high levels of waste products.
If these tests aren’t clear you may need other tests, such as:
Intravenous pyelogram (IVP). A series of X-rays of the kidney, ureters (the tubes connecting the kidneys and bladder), and bladder is done after a contrast dye is injected into a vein. This is done to look for tumors, kidney stones, or any blockages, and to check blood flow in the kidneys.
Ultrasound. An imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the organs of the urinary tract on a computer screen.
Cystoscopy. A thin, flexible tube and viewing device, is put in through the urethra to examine the parts of the urinary tract for structure changes or blockages, such as tumors or stones.
How is blood in the urine treated?
If you have blood in your urine that lasts more than a day, see a health care provider, especially if you have unexplained weight loss, discomfort with urination, frequent urination, or urgent urination.
Treatment will depend on the cause of the blood in the urine.

Hemochromatosis,
Hemophilia,"What is hemophilia?
Hemophilia is an inherited bleeding disorder. Children with hemophilia can’t stop bleeding because they don’t have enough clotting factor in their blood. Clotting factors are needed for blood to clot. Blood clots to prevent excessive bleeding.
There are many blood clotting factors involved in the forming of clots to stop bleeding. Two common factors that affect blood clotting are factor VIII and factor IX.
How severe your child’s hemophilia is depends on the level of blood clotting factors in his or her blood.
The 3 main forms of hemophilia include:
Hemophilia A. This is caused by a lack of the blood clotting factor VIII. About 9 out of 10 people with hemophilia have type A disease. This is also referred to as classic hemophilia or factor VIII deficiency. 
Hemophilia B. This is caused by a deficiency of factor IX. This is also called Christmas disease or factor IX deficiency. 
Hemophilia C. Some doctors use this term to refer to a lack of clotting factor XI. "
Hepatitis,"Hepatitis is a general term used to describe inflammation of the liver. Liver inflammation can be caused by several viruses (viral hepatitis), chemicals, drugs, alcohol, certain genetic disorders or by an overactive immune system that mistakenly attacks the liver, called autoimmune hepatitis. Depending on its course, hepatitis can be acute, which flares up suddenly and then goes away, or chronic, which is a long-term condition usually producing more subtle symptoms and progressive liver damage.
Types of Hepatitis
There are five viruses that cause the different forms of viral hepatitis: hepatitis A, B, C, D and E. Hepatitis A is mostly a food-borne illness and can be spread through contaminated water and unwashed food. It is the easiest to transmit, especially in children, but is also the least likely to damage the liver and is usually mild and is completely resolved within six months. Hepatitis B can be transmitted through exposure to contaminated blood, needles, syringes or bodily fluids and from mother to baby. It is a chronic disorder and in some cases may lead to long-term liver damage, liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver after many years of carrying the virus. Hepatitis C is only transmitted through infected blood or from mother to newborn during childbirth. It too can lead to liver cancer and cirrhosis in the long term. Hepatitis D is only found in people who are also infected with hepatitis B. Hepatitis E is predominantly found in Africa, Asia and South America. Certain generally safe medications can be toxic to the liver and cause hepatitis (drug-induced hepatitis) when taken in excess or in very high doses. These include acetaminophen (Tylenol) and even vitamin A. Check with your pediatrician about appropriate dosing for your child.
Autoimmune hepatitis
Hepatitis A
Hepatitis B
Hepatitis C
Hepatitis D
Hepatitis E
Neonatal hepatitis
Symptoms
Malaise
Abdominal tenderness, especially in the upper right corner
Fatigue
Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and the white portion of the eyes)
Dark-colored urine
Lightly colored stools
Abdominal pain
Nausea with or without vomiting
Abdominal swelling due to fluid retention
Diagnosis
The following are required to diagnose hepatitis:
Physical exam, which may or may not reveal a swollen, enlarged liver
Blood tests to check liver enzymes that are elevated when the liver is damaged or infected, as well as blood tests to check for the presence of any of the five viruses causing hepatitis
Ultrasound of the liver to detect any changes
Liver biopsy to confirm suspected inflammation when other tests are inconclusive and to determine the exact degree of liver damage
Treatment
To prevent infection, children — or anyone who has not been previously vaccinated — should be vaccinated against hepatitis B and hepatitis A. There are no vaccines against hepatitis types C, D and E. There is no cure for hepatitis once it occurs. Treatment focuses on preventing further damage to the liver, reversing existing damage if possible and symptom relief. Most cases of acute hepatitis will resolve over time. In autoimmune hepatitis, certain medications may be used to help keep the overactive immune system in check and prevent further attacks on the liver.
When to Call for Help?
If your child develops symptoms suggestive of liver inflammation, as listed above, call your pediatrician.

Herpes,"What is herpes?
Herpes is a contagious viral disease. There are two different strains of herpes simplex viruses:
Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) is usually associated with infections of the lips, mouth, and face and is spread by infected saliva, via the infection site or toys, cups, cosmetics, etc. Most cases are acquired in childhood. HSV-1 often causes lesions inside or around the mouth, such as cold sores (fever blisters). Individuals with a cold sore should avoid contact with newborn infants. Caregivers with a cold sore should wear a surgical mask and scrupulously wash their hands.
Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) is sexually transmitted. Symptoms include genital ulcers or sores. The virus can also lead to complications such as infection of the lining of the brain and the brain itself (meningoencephalitis) or infection of the eye (especially the conjunctiva and cornea). Cross-infection of type 1 and 2 viruses may occur from oral-genital contact. The herpes virus can infect the fetus and cause abnormalities. A mother who is infected with herpes may transmit the virus to her newborn during vaginal delivery, especially if she has an active infection at the time of delivery. It's possible for the virus to be transmitted even when there are no symptoms or visible sores.
Symptoms of Birth-acquired Herpes
Fluid filled blisters
Breathing difficulties
Lethargy
Seizures
Jaundice
Bleeding easily
Coma
Diagnosis
Diagnosis of herpes can be made on the basis of the appearance or culture of the lesion. Examination may also show enlargement of lymph nodes in the neck or groin. Laboratory tests, including spinal fluid and urine cultures, may also be used. 
Treatment
There is no cure for herpes, but there is treatment of its symptoms. Herpes virus infections in infants are generally treated with intravenous medications. Acyclovir is the most common antiviral medicine used for this purpose. A course of several weeks may be required. Infants with systemic herpes or encephalitis frequently have poor outcomes despite antiviral medications and early intervention. Infants with the skin disease may have recurrences after therapy is finished."
Hip dysplasia,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Developmental dysplasia of the hip often runs in families.
If untreated, developmental dysplasia of the hip can lead to pain or problems with walking.
Girls are more likely to have developmental dysplasia of the hip than boys.
Treatment methods include bracing, casting and/or surgery to promote proper formation and position of the hip joint."
Hirschsprung’s disease,"What is Hirschsprung’s disease?
Hirschsprung's disease (also called colonic aganglionosis) is a blockage of the large intestine due to improper muscle movement in the bowel. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present from birth.
Causes
In Hirschsprung's disease, certain types of nerve cells (called ganglion cells) are missing from a part of the bowel. In areas without such nerves, the muscle within the bowel wall does not contract to push material through, which causes a blockage. Intestinal contents build up behind the blockage, swelling the bowel and abdomen.
Hirschsprung's disease causes about 25 percent of all newborn intestinal blockages, but is also identified in older babies and children. It occurs five times more often in males than in females. Hirschsprung's disease is sometimes associated with other inherited or congenital conditions, such as Down syndrome.
Symptoms
Infants:
Difficulty or straining with bowel movements
Failure to pass meconium (stool) shortly after birth (within 24 to 48 hours)
Infrequent but explosive stools
Jaundice
Poor feeding
Poor weight gain
Vomiting
Watery diarrhea (in the newborn) 
Older children:
Constipation that gradually gets worse (patients may need to take laxatives regularly)
Fecal impaction
Malnutrition
Slow growth
Diagnosis
Milder cases may not be diagnosed until a later age. During a physical examination, the doctor may be able to feel loops of bowel in the swollen belly. A rectal examination may reveal a loss of muscle tone in the rectal muscles.
Tests used to help diagnose Hirschsprung's disease may include:
Abdominal X-ray
Barium enema: an X-ray that shows the shape of the rectum and colon
Anal manometry: measurement of pressure within the rectum using an inflatable balloon
Rectal biopsy: A suction tube is used to collect tissue from the inside of the rectum. This tissue can then be examined under a microscope to determine if ganglion cells are present. Although biopsy results can sometimes be inconclusive, this is usually the best test to determine if a child with symptoms has the disease.
Treatment
Before the operation, a procedure called serial rectal irrigation helps relieve pressure in (decompress) the bowel. The abnormal sections of colon and rectum must be removed with surgery to permit the child to pass stools easily. The healthy part of the colon is then moved into the child’s pelvis and attached to the anus.
Sometimes this can be done in one operation, but it is often done in two parts (also called a “staged procedure”). If performed in one operation, the surgeon will connect the colon to the anus immediately after removing the abnormal colon and rectum. If performed as a staged procedure, first step is to remove the diseased colon and rectum, followed by a colostomy. When a colostomy is performed, the cut edge of the large intestine is brought to an opening that is made through the wall of the abdomen. This allows bowel contents to empty into a bag. Later, when the child’s weight, age and condition have improved, a pull-through procedure is performed, which removes the colostomy and connects the large intestine to the anus to permit the child to pass normal bowel movements.
Recovery
Symptoms improve or go away in most children after surgery. A small number of children may have constipation or problems controlling stools (fecal incontinence). In general, children who are treated early and those with limited disease (which allows the surgeon to leave more healthy bowel in place) have better outcomes."
Histiocytosis,"Histiocytosis, also referred to as Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), and formally called Histiocytosis X, represents a group of rare disorders involving specific cells that normally have important roles as part of the immune system. While the cause of LCH is unknown, LCH can frequently behave like cancer and so is treated by cancer specialists. 
Histiocytosis is a generic name for a group of syndromes characterized by an abnormal increase in the number of certain immune cells called histiocytes. These include monocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells.
A histiocyte is a normal immune cell that is found in many parts of the body especially in the bone marrow, the blood stream, the skin, the liver, the lungs, the lymph glands and the spleen. In histiocytosis, the histiocytes move into tissues where they are not normally found and cause damage to those tissues. These proliferating immune cells may form tumors, which can affect various parts of the body.
LCH is often classified as single system, when the disease affects only one part of the body, or multisystem, when it affects more than one part of the body.  In children, histiocytosis usually involves the bones and may consist of single or multiple sites. The skull is frequently affected.  Children over five years of age usually have the single system disease, with just bone involvement. Young children, especially infants, are more likely to have the multisystem disease.
Most cases of histiocytosis affect children between the ages of one and 15 years, although people of all ages can develop LCH. The incidence peaks among children between 5 and 10 years old. Histiocytosis is thought to affect roughly one to two out of 200,000 people each year.
Risk Factors
The exact cause of histiocytosis is unknown. However, recent studies indicate that it is caused by the development and expansion of an abnormal Langerhans cell that subsequently leads to the accumulation of other cells of the immune system, resulting in collections or tumors in various areas of the body. Some forms are genetic.
Cancer Symptoms
The first sign of histiocytosis is often a rash on the scalp, similar to cradle cap. There may be a pain in a bone, discharge from the ear, loss of appetite and fever. Sometimes the stomach is swollen and painful. Occasionally, an area of the brain known as the pituitary gland is affected, and this can lead to the child passing large amounts of urine and being very thirsty. Other potential signs and symptoms include: weight loss, jaundice, vomiting, limping, short stature, delayed puberty, mental deterioration, headache, dizziness, seizures, protruding eyeballs, and/or a generalized rash.
The tumors produce a ""punched-out"" appearance on bone X-rays. Sometimes, children experience spontaneous fractures as a result of these bone lesions. There is often systemic involvement as well, which may affect the whole body and cause rashes, lung problems, gum infiltration, lymph gland swelling, hormonal problems, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and anemia.
Diagnostic Tests
Diagnostic tests include: a biopsy, in which a small sample of skin and/or bone is taken and examined under a microscope for abnormal cells; routine and sometimes specialized X-rays and scans of the bones, the skull, and the lungs; and blood tests. These tests will help the doctor determine if the disease is the single system or multisystem type.
An X-ray of the entire skeletal system may be done to determine how extensive the disease is and whether or not the systemic involvement is indicated.
Treatment
Depending on the extent of the disease, LCH is often treated with chemotherapy and steroids to suppress the function of the immune system and the production of histiocytes. The length of treatment will vary from child to child. Many patients are eligible for international as well as local institutional trials.
Radiation therapy, treatment with targeted X-rays, or limited surgery may also be used to treat bone lesions.
The majority of children who develop histiocytosis have complete recoveries, with older children having the highest recovery rates. Sometimes the disease can recur, so the child will have regularly scheduled follow-up visits in the outpatient clinic as a precaution. 
Research
New ideas are being tested to determine the causes of LCH as well as why some patients respond better to treatment than others. New types of therapies are being developed, including new types of drugs, as are approaches that direct antibodies or small molecules to the abnormal Langerhans cell while sparing the normal tissues.
The Division of Pediatric Oncology has a comprehensive program of consultation and care for treatment of patients with Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH). 
In addition, research is being directed toward the development of antibody-targeted approaches for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LCH.

Hoarseness,"What is hoarseness?
Hoarseness is a condition marked by changes in the pitch or quality of the voice, which may sound weak, scratchy or husky. Hoarseness can be caused by misuse or overuse of the voice, viruses, and growths on the vocal cords like cysts, papillomas, polyps and nodules, among other things. Acid reflux from the stomach may also cause hoarseness.
What are symptoms of hoarseness?
Abnormally weak, breathy or coarse voice
Change in voice pitch
Using that the voice is more effortful or fatigues easily
Depending on the underlying condition causing the hoarseness, other symptoms may be present. For example, a viral illness can also result in a sore throat, coughing and sneezing. Sometimes, hoarseness can be associated with change in swallowing or breathing.
How is hoarseness diagnosed?
Physical exam of the head and neck
Laryngoscopy (visualization of the larynx with a laryngoscope), usually performed in a doctor’s office
Possibly imaging tests of the vocal cords and throat
Hoarseness Treatment
The underlying cause will determine the treatment, so proper testing and diagnosis are crucial. Hoarseness caused by a viral infection will go away on its own most of the time. Other conditions may require treatment other than watchful waiting — for instance, hoarseness related to a growth on the vocal cords generally will not improve unless the lesion is removed surgically.
When to Call for Help
If hoarseness does not resolve on its own within a week or two, if it causes difficulty in your social or professional life, or if it is associated with other symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, difficulty breathing or an enlarged lymph node in your neck, an otolaryngologist should evaluate your voice changes."
Hydrocephalus,"Hydrocephalus is a condition characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) within the ventricles of the brain. CSF surrounds the brain and spinal cord. When the circulatory path of the CSF is blocked, fluid begins to accumulate, causing the ventricles to enlarge and the pressure inside the head to increase, resulting in hydrocephalus.
What are the different types of hydrocephalus?
Communicating hydrocephalus occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked after it exits the ventricles. The word “communicating” refers to the fact that CSF can still flow between the ventricles, which remain open.
Non-communicating hydrocephalus - also called obstructive hydrocephalus - occurs when the flow of CSF is blocked along one or more of the narrow passages connecting the ventricles. One of the most common causes is aqueductal stenosis, a narrowing of the aqueduct of Sylvius, a small passage between the third and fourth ventricles in the middle of the brain.
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a form of communicating hydrocephalus that can strike people at any age, but it is most common among the elderly. It may result from a subarachnoid hemorrhage, head trauma, infection, tumor or complications of surgery. However, many people develop normal pressure hydrocephalus even when none of these factors are present for reasons that are unknown. In that case it is called idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus.
Hydrocephalus may be also be classified as congenital or acquired. Congenital hydrocephalus is present at birth and may be caused by either events or influences that occur during fetal development, or genetic abnormalities. In rare cases, congenital hydrocephalus may not cause symptoms in childhood but only manifest in adulthood and may be associated with aqueductal stenosis.
Acquired hydrocephalus develops at the time of birth or at some point afterward. This type of hydrocephalus can affect individuals of all ages and may be caused by injury or disease.
Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo is another form of hydrocephalus that does not fit exactly into the categories mentioned above and primarily affects adults. Hydrocephalus ex-vacuo occurs when stroke, degenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease or other dementias or traumatic injury cause damage to the brain. In these cases, brain tissue may actually shrink.
What are the symptoms of hydrocephalus?
The possible triad of symptoms typically present as follows:
gait disturbance and difficulty walking
mild dementia
impaired bladder control
These symptoms may not occur all at the same time, and sometimes only one or two symptoms are present. The triad of symptoms is often associated with the aging process and a majority of the NPH population is older than 60 years.
How is hydrocephalus diagnosed?
Once a type of hydrocephalus is suspected by a primary physician, one or more of the following tests are usually recommended to confirm the diagnosis and assess the person’s candidacy for shunt treatment. It is important that at this point a neurosurgeon and/or neurologist become part of the medical team. Their involvement is helpful not only in interpreting test results and selecting likely candidates for shunting, but also in discussing the actual surgery and follow-up care as well as expectations and risks of surgery.
Clinical Exams – consists of an interview and or a physical/neurologic examination
Brain images to detect enlarged ventricles
MRI

CT or CAT scan
CSF tests to predict shunt responsiveness and/or determine shunt pressure

Lumbar or spinal tap – large volume

External lumbar drainage

Measurement of CSF outflow resistance
What treatment options are available?
The only available treatment for hydrocephalus is the surgical implantation of a shunt, a device that channels CSF sway from the brain to another part of the body where it can be absorbed. Most shunt systems consist of three components:
A collection catheter situated within the cerebral ventricles
A valve mechanism to control how much CFS flows
An exit catheter to drain the CSF to another part of the body
After the surgery, all components of the shunt system are entirely under the skin, and nothing is exposed to the outside. A limited number of individuals can be treated with an alternative procedure called endoscopic third ventriculostomy. In this procedure, a neuroendoscope — a small camera that uses fiber optic technology to visualize small and difficult to reach surgical areas — allows a doctor to view the ventricular surface. Once the scope is guided into position, a small tool makes a tiny hole in the floor of the third ventricle, which allows the CSF to bypass the obstruction and flow toward the site of resorption around the surface of the brain.
Who is a likely candidate for shunting?
No one single factor is reliable in predicting success from implantation of a shunt. The following findings are generally associated with a better outcome following shunt placement:
The onset of gait disturbance as the first and most prominent symptom
A known cause for NPH, such as a trauma or hemorrhage
The scan shows the ventricle size to be disproportionately larger than the CSF in the subarachnoid space
Removal of spinal fluid via lumbar puncture or lumbar catheter gives dramatic, temporary relief of symptoms
ICP or spinal fluid pressure monitoring shows an abnormal range or pattern of spinal fluid pressure or an elevated CSF outflow resistance
A complete recovery is possible, but it is not often seen. Many individuals and their families are satisfied when shunt surgery results in reduced disability or dependence than he or she had before surgery, or prevention of further neurological deterioration.

Hyperprolactinemia,"What is hyperprolactinemia?
Hyperprolactinemia is marked by abnormally high levels of the hormone prolactin (which stimulates breast milk production during and after pregnancy) in the blood. It is caused by a benign tumor (prolactoma) in the pituitary gland, which controls production of this hormone. It is not clear what causes prolactomas to develop. They appear to occur spontaneously and are not inherited. The tumor can develop both in men and women. In some cases, tumors other than prolactomas that are located in or around the pituitary block the flow of dopamine from the brain to the prolactin-secreting cells leading to hyperprolactinemia. Another cause of hyperprolactinemia is hypothyroidism or underactive thyroid.
Symptoms
If prolactoma is suspected, blood tests can determine if prolactin levels are higher than normal. MRI and CT imaging can be used to look for tumors and determine their exact location and size.
Treatment
Several medications can decrease levels of prolactin and relates symptoms. Surgery is an option if medications fail to return prolactin levels to normal and reduce tumor size. 
When to Call for Help
If any of the above signs develop in your child, talk to your pediatrician. "
Hyperthyroidism,"Hyperthyroidism means your thyroid gland is too active. This tiny gland is found in your neck. An overactive thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. This makes your metabolism work at a faster rate.
What causes hyperthyroidism?
Hyperthyroidism has several causes. These include:
Graves' disease. This is an autoimmune disorder. It is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It happens when an antibody overstimulates the thyroid. This condition is most often found in young to middle-aged women. It also tends to run in families.
Toxic nodular goiter. This condition happens when 1 or more lumps (nodules) of the thyroid gland become too active. Health experts don't know what causes this to happen.
Thyroiditis. It occurs when the thyroid becomes irritated. It temporarily causes the thyroid to be overactive. The thyroid then often becomes underactive.
Hyperthyroidism may occur for other reasons. These include:
Taking too much thyroid hormone medicine to treat an underactive thyroid
Having too much iodine in your diet
Having a noncancer (benign) tumor in the pituitary gland that makes your thyroid overactive
Who is at risk for hyperthyroidism?
These things may make it more likely for you to have hyperthyroidism:
You are a woman
You are older than age 60
You have had thyroid problems in the past
Your family has a history of thyroid problems
You have certain conditions, such as type 1 diabetes
You consume too much iodine. This can happen if you eat a lot of iodine-rich foods or take too much medicine that has this chemical.
You are pregnant or have had a baby in the last 6 months
What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?
Symptoms and signs are different for each person. Here are the most common ones:
Nervousness
Irritability
Sweating more than normal
Thinning of the skin
Fine, brittle hair
Weak muscles, especially in the upper arms and thighs
Shaky hands
Fast heartbeat (palpitations)
High blood pressure
More bowel movements than normal
Weight loss
Problems sleeping
Prominent eyes
Sensitivity to bright light
Confusion
Irregular menstrual cycle in women
Tiredness and lack of energy (fatigue)
Thyroid gland is larger than normal (goiter)
These symptoms may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is hyperthyroidism diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will ask about your medical history. You will also need an exam. Other tests that can help diagnose hyperthyroidism include:
Blood tests. They can measure the amount of thyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.
Thyroid ultrasound. This test can see if your thyroid gland has any nodules.
Thyroid scan. This test uses a radioactive substance to make an image of the thyroid.
How is hyperthyroidism treated?
Treatment will depend on your symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
Treatment may include:
Medicine. It can help lower the level of thyroid hormones in the blood.
Radioactive iodine. It comes in the form of a pill or liquid. It slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland so that less thyroid hormone is made.
Surgery. You may need to have all or part of your thyroid removed.
Beta blockers. These medicines block the action of the thyroid hormone on the body. That helps with rapid heart rate and palpitations.
Steroids. These can be used to quiet the inflammation causing some forms of thyroiditis.
What are the complications of hyperthyroidism?
If your hyperthyroidism is not treated, these complications may happen:
Thyroid crisis, when symptoms get worse because of stress or illness
Heart problems, such as an abnormal rhythm or heart failure
Weak, brittle bones (osteoporosis)
Pregnancy problems, such as miscarriage, early delivery, and preeclampsia or high blood pressure
When should I call my health care provider?
Tell your healthcare provider if your symptoms get worse or you have new symptoms. If you are a woman of childbearing age and want to become pregnant, talk with your provider first.
Key points about hyperthyroidism

Hyperventilation,"What is hyperventilation?
Hyperventilation is rapid or deep breathing, usually caused by anxiety or panic. This overbreathing, as it is sometimes called, may actually leave you feeling breathless. 
When you breathe, you inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Excessive breathing may lead to low levels of carbon dioxide in your blood, which causes many of the symptoms that you may feel if you hyperventilate. 
Symptoms and Diagnosis
Associated symptoms include: 
Dizziness or lightheadedness 
Shortness of breath 
Belching, bloating, dry mouth 
Weakness, confusion 
Sleep disturbances 
Numbness and tingling in your arms or around your mouth 
Muscle spasms in hands and feet, chest pain and palpitations
Treatment
The goal in treating hyperventilation is to raise the carbon dioxide level in the blood. There are several ways to do this: 
Reassurance from a friend or family member can help relax your breathing. Words like “you are doing fine,” “you are not having a heart attack” and “you are not going to die” are very helpful. It is extremely important that the person helping you remain calm and deliver these messages with a soft, relaxed tone. 
To increase your carbon dioxide, you need to take in less oxygen. To accomplish this, you can breathe through pursed lips (as if you are blowing out a candle) or you can cover your mouth and one nostril, breathing through the other nostril. 
If anxiety or panic has been diagnosed, see a psychologist or psychiatrist to help you understand and treat your condition. 
Learn breathing exercises that help you relax and breathe from your diaphragm and abdomen, rather than your chest wall. 
Practice relaxation techniques regularly, such as progressive muscle relaxation or meditation. 
Exercise regularly."
Hypocalcemia,"What is hypocalcemia?
Hypocalcemia is a condition in which there is too little calcium in the blood. Normal calcium levels are essential for the heart and muscles to work properly as well as to ensure bone development. In a baby, some common causes of hypocalcemia are premature birth, infections, maternal diabetes and some medications. Hypocalcemia can be caused by vitamin D deficiency, which can occur in breastfed babies who are not given vitamin D supplements. Rare causes of hypocalcemia include hyperparathyroidism (a disorder of the pituitary gland) and pseudohypoparathyroidism, a genetic disorder that mimics hypoparathyroidism.   
Symptoms
There are frequently no symptoms of hypocalcemia. When present, symptoms include: 
Short stature 
Dry skin 
Dry hair 
Brittle nails 
Muscle cramps 
Tingling in the fingers and toes 
Cataracts 
Weakened tooth enamel   
Seizures 
Diagnosis
Diagnosis can be made with a blood test to check calcium levels. Measuring blood levels of parathyroid hormone and vitamin D can help determine the cause of the hypocalcemia.
Treatment
Restoring normal calcium levels with calcium supplements is important because long-term hypocalcemia can cause poor bone formation, and brittle bones that are prone to fractures. Vitamin D supplements may be given. .
When to Call for Help

Hypopituitarism,"What is hypopituitarism?
Hypopituitarism happens when your pituitary gland is not active enough. The front lobe of the gland may only partly work. Or it may not work at all. As a result the gland does not make enough hormones.
What causes hypopituitarism?
Causes of hypopituitarism can directly affect the pituitary gland. Or they can indirectly affect the gland through changes in the hypothalamus. Direct causes are:
Pituitary tumors
Poor blood supply to the pituitary gland
Infections or inflammatory diseases
Sarcoidosis, a rare inflammation of the lymph nodes and other tissues throughout the body
Amyloidosis, a rare disease that causes a buildup of protein and starch (amyloid) in tissues and organs
Radiation therapy
Surgery to remove pituitary tissue
Autoimmune diseases
Head trauma
Genetic diseases
Indirect causes are:
Tumors of the hypothalamus
Inflammatory disease or a disease that spreads, such as cancer 
Head injuries
Surgical damage to the hypothalamus or blood vessels or nerves leading to it
What are the symptoms of hypopituitarism?
Symptoms are different for each person. They may happen over time or right away. They depend on which hormones the pituitary gland is not making enough of. These hormone deficiencies, and the symptoms they cause, include:
Not enough gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone). This affects men and women who have not gone through menopause. Women may not have a menstrual period. They may have problems with fertility, vaginal dryness, and loss of some female traits. Men may have problems with fertility, sexual function, and loss of some male traits. Children will not go through puberty.
Not enough growth hormone. Adults with this problem may lose bone and muscle mass. In children, it can lead to stunted growth and dwarfism.
Not enough thyroid-stimulating hormone. This often leads to an underactive thyroid. It may cause lack of energy (fatigue), confusion, problems with cold temperatures, weight gain, constipation, and dry skin.
Not enough ACTH (adrenocorticotropin hormone). This is rare. Your pituitary gland may not secrete ACTH if you have been taking adrenal steroid hormones and stop taking them suddenly. It leads to an underactive adrenal gland. You may have low blood pressure, low blood sugar, feel tired, and be easily stressed.
Not enough prolactin. This is rare. Women who lack this hormone may not be able to make breastmilk after childbirth.
Not enough antidiuretic hormone (also called vasopressin). This leads to increased urine output and thirst.
These symptoms may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is hypopituitarism diagnosed?
Your health care provider will ask about your past health. You will also need an exam. Other tests you may need:
CT scan. This test uses X-rays and computer technology to make images of your body.
MRI. This test makes 2-dimensional views of your organs or body structures.
Blood and urine tests. These tests measure levels of hormones in your body.
How is hypopituitarism treated?
Your health care provider will figure out the best treatment for you based on:
How old you are
Your overall health and past health
How sick you are
How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Treatment of hypopituitarism depends on what is causing it. The goal of treatment is have the pituitary gland work as it should. Treatment may include:
Hormone replacement therapy
Surgery to remove a tumor
Radiation therapy

Hypospadias,"What is hypospadias?
Hyposadias is a congenital defect noted in boys. The location of the meatus (outlet for urine on the penis) is located on the undersurface of the penis rather than on the tip of the penis. Most often this is noted at the time of birth. The foreskin does not completely surround the head of the penis and is deficient on the undersurface of the penis. There can also be some associated bending of the penis, known as chordee. In the mildest forms of hypospadias, the opening is located on the glans (head of the penis). The most severe forms have the opening located between the halves of the scrotum, and the sex of the child may be in doubt. A variant of hypospadias is the megameatus intact prepuce form (MIP), in which the foreskin is completely formed. This type of hypospadias may be missed at birth and may only be noted at the time of or following circumcision. Other congenital anomalies may be noted to be present with hypospadias, so a thorough physical examination should be conducted at birth.
Treatment
Hypospadias is treated with surgery. The type of procedures needed for reconstruction are dependent on the degree of the hypospadias. Most of the mild forms can be corrected using a single procedure in the outpatient setting, however severe forms of hypospadias may require two or more procedures for correction and may need hospitalization. The goal of the reconstruction is to straighten the penis (correct the chordee), bring the opening (meatus) to the tip of the penis and make the penis as cosmetically close to the normal as possible. Although surgical correction can be performed at any age, most pediatric urologists would do the surgery between 6 and 17 months of age.
Following surgery, a stent (tube) may be left in place in the reconstructed penis to drain the urine, and a dressing is left in place. The length of time that the stent and dressing are used is variable but is most frequently a week. The dressings and the stent are removed in the office. Boys are treated with oral pain medication if they are operated on in the outpatient surgery center.
Complications following surgery include fistula (a hole in the channel that is reconstructed) diagnosed by noting urine dripping from a second opening when the child is urinating, and meatal stenosis (scarring of the new opening) diagnosed by a narrowing of the urine stream. Additionally the new channel that is created can scar and cause a stricture, or even complete breakdown of the repair is possible. All of these complications require further surgical repair. With advances in surgical techniques, complications have been reduced considerably.
If hypospadias is noted at birth, it is strongly recommended that the child not have a circumcision. The foreskin that is removed at the time of circumcision is used for the reconstruction of the hypospadias.

Hypothyroidism,"What is hypothyroidism?
 Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland, located in the front of the neck, does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which control overall metabolism and many bodily functions. Hypothyroidism can have several causes, including an autoimmune disorder (Hashimoto’s disease), in which the body’s immune system mistakenly destructs its own thyroid gland. In teens, this is perhaps the most common cause of underactive thyroid, compared to other causes of the condition. Other causes could be certain medications or pituitary hypothyroidism, in which the pituitary gland, which controls the thyroid gland. Sometimes, a cause cannot be identified.
While the condition typically develops in adult life — its incidence increases with age — congenital hypothyroidism can occur in children and even newborns. One out of every 4,000 to 5,000 thousand babies born in the United States has hypothyroidism.
Undiagnosed hypothyroid children may experience slowed growth rate.
Additional symptoms include sluggishness, pallor, dry and itchy scalp, increased sensitivity to cold and constipation. If untreated, the condition may have devastating effects, such as stunted physical growth and mental retardation.
Symptoms
Slowed growth rate
Puffy face
Swollen hands and feet
Poor muscle tone
Sluggishness, sleepiness
Constipation
Fatigue
Dry, itchy scalp
Dry, coarse skin
Heavy menstruation in girls
Mood swings
Weight gain
Hoarse cry or voice
Dry, coarse skin
Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter)
Diagnosis
A physician will suspect underactive thyroid if several of the above symptoms are present; however, a definitive diagnosis can be easily made by testing the level of a pituitary hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). If the thyroid is producing normal levels of thyroid hormones, TSH will be within normal range. However if the thyroid is underactive, then the pituitary starts secreting more TSH to jump-start the sluggish thyroid. Thus, a higher-than-normal level of TSH indicates an underactive thyroid. Most newborns are tested for hypothyroidism within 72 hours of birth as part of a routine screen for other conditions.  
When to Call for Help
If you see any of the above symptoms in your baby, infant or child — particularly slow growth — call your pediatrician.  
Treatment
Replacement therapy with synthetic thyroid hormones in the form of a single daily tablet is usually given. Thyroid hormones are critical for normal brain development in babies and children, therefore treatment with the correct dose of synthetic hormone is very important. Because the body can require higher doses of synthetic hormone over time, the child should be retested periodically to make sure the right amount of hormone is given and the dose is adjusted as needed.
 "
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,"What is immune thrombocytopenic purpura?
Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a blood disorder characterized by a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are cells in the blood that help stop bleeding. A decrease in platelets can cause easy bruising, bleeding gums, and internal bleeding. This disease is caused by an immune reaction against one's own platelets. It has also been called autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura.
Thrombocytopenia means a decreased number of platelets in the blood.
Purpura refers to the purple discoloring of the skin, as with a bruise.
ITP is a fairly common blood disorder that both children and adults can develop.
There are two forms of ITP:
Acute thrombocytopenic purpura. This usually affects young children, ages 2 to 6 years old. The symptoms may follow a viral illness, such as chickenpox. Acute ITP usually starts suddenly and the symptoms usually disappear in less than 6 months, often within a few weeks. Treatment is often not needed. The disorder usually does not recur. Acute ITP is the most common form of the disorder.
Chronic thrombocytopenic purpura. The onset of the disorder can happen at any age, and the symptoms can last a minimum of 6 months, several years, or a lifetime. Adults have this form more often than children do, but it does affect adolescents. Females have it more often than males. Chronic ITP can recur often and requires continual follow-up care with a blood specialist (hematologist).
What causes idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?
In ITP, the immune system is stimulated to attack your body's own platelets. Most often this is a result of antibody production against platelets. In a small number of cases, a type of white blood cell called T-cells will directly attack platelets. This immune system error may be a result of any of the following:
Medications (including over-the-counter medications) can cause an allergy that cross-reacts with platelets.
Infections, typically viral infections, including the viruses that cause chicken pox, hepatitis C, and AIDS, can prompt antibodies that cross-react with platelets.
Pregnancy
Immune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus
Low-grade lymphomas and leukemias may produce abnormal antibodies against platelet proteins.
Sometimes the cause of immune thrombocytopenic purpura is not known.
What are the symptoms of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura?
Normal platelet count is in the range of 150,000 to 450,000. With ITP, the platelet count is less than 100,000. By the time significant bleeding occurs, you may have a platelet count of less than 10,000. The lower the platelet count, the greater the risk of bleeding.
Because platelets help stop bleeding, the symptoms of ITP are related to increased bleeding. However, each person may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
The purple color of the skin after blood has ""leaked"" under it. A bruise is blood under the skin. Persons with ITP may have large bruises from no known injury. Bruises can appear at the joints of elbows and knees just from movement.
Tiny red dots under the skin that are a result of very small bleeds.
Nosebleeds
Bleeding in the mouth and/or in and around the gums
Heavy menstrual periods
Blood in the vomit, urine, or stool
Bleeding in the head. This is the most dangerous symptom of ITP. Any head injury that occurs when there are not enough platelets to stop the bleeding can be life threatening.
The symptoms of ITP may look like other medical problems. Always consult your health care provider for a diagnosis.
How is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura diagnosed?
In addition to a complete medical history and physical exam, you may have these tests:
Complete blood count (CBC). A measurement of size, number, and maturity of different blood cells in a specific volume of blood (to measure platelets.
Additional blood and urine tests. These tests are done to measure bleeding time and detect possible infections, including a special blood test called an antiplatelet antibody test.
Careful review of your medications
Historically, a bone marrow aspiration was required to make a diagnosis of ITP. It may not be absolutely necessary in the face of a positive antiplatelet antibody test, but it is still commonly done to look at the production of platelets and to rule out any abnormal cells the marrow may be producing that could lower platelet counts. A bone marrow aspiration is necessary for a diagnosis if the antiplatelet antibody testing is negative.
How is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura treated?
Specific treatment for idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura will be determined by your health care provider based on:
Your age, overall health, and medical history
Extent of the disease
Your tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the disease
Your opinion or preference
When treatment is necessary, the two most common forms of immediate treatment are steroids and intravenous gamma globulin:
Steroids. Steroids help prevent bleeding by reducing the rate of platelet destruction. Steroids, if effective, will result in an increase in platelet counts seen within 2 to 3 weeks. Side effects may include irritability, stomach irritation, weight gain, high blood pressure, and acne.
Intravenous gamma globulin (IVGG). Intravenous gamma globulin (IVGG) is a protein that contains many antibodies and also slows the destruction of platelets. IVGG works faster than steroids (within 24 to 48 hours).
Other treatments for ITP may include:
Rh immune globulin. This medication temporarily stops the spleen from destroying platelets. You must be Rh positive and have a spleen for this medication to be effective.
Medication changes. If it is a medication that is the suspected cause, discontinuation or changing the medication may be necessary.
Infection treatment. If infection is the cause for ITP, then treatment of the infection may result in higher platelet counts.
Splenectomy. In some cases, your spleen may need to be removed since this is the most active site of antibody mediated platelet destruction. This is considered more often in people with chronic ITP to decrease the rate of platelet destruction.
Platelet transfusion. People with severe bleeding or about to go into surgery may require platelet transfusion.
Rituximab (Rituxan). This medication is an antibody produced in a lab against a protein found on the blood cells that make antibodies. It slows the antiplatelet antibody production.
Romiplostim (N-plate) and eltrombopag (Promacta). These medications were recently approved for the treatment of ITP that has failed other types of treatment. They stimulate the bone marrow to produce more platelets.
Lifestyle changes. These can include making sure that you use protective gear and that you avoid certain activities.
Key points about immune thrombocytopenic purpura
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a blood disorder characterized by an abnormal decrease in the number of platelets in the blood.
A decrease in platelets can result in easy bruising, bleeding gums, and internal bleeding.
ITP may be acute and resolve in less than 6 months, or chronic and last longer than 6 months.
Treatment options include a variety of medications that can reduce the destruction of platelets or increase their production.
In some cases, surgery to remove the spleen is necessary.

Imperforate anus,"What is an imperforate anus?
Imperforate anus is a congenital (present from birth) defect in which the opening to the anus is missing or blocked. Imperforate anus may occur in several forms. The rectum may end in a blind pouch that does not connect with the colon, or it may have openings to the urethra, bladder, the base of penis or scrotum in boys or the vagina in girls. There may also be stenosis (narrowing) or a complete absence of the anus. The problem is caused by abnormal development of the fetus and may be associated with other birth defects. Imperforate anus is a relatively common condition that occurs in about 1 out of 5,000 infants.
Symptoms
No passage of first stool within 24 to 48 hours after birth
Stool passes out of the vagina, base of penis, scrotum or urethra
Swollen belly
Diagnosis
A doctor can diagnose this condition during a physical exam. Imaging tests may be recommended to determine which structures are abnormally connected or absent and to plan for surgical repair.
Treatment
The infant should be checked for other problems, especially those affecting the genitals, urinary tract and spine. Surgical reconstruction of the anus is often needed. If the rectum connects with other organs, repair of these organs will also be necessary through abdominal surgery. A temporary colostomy is often required. When a colostomy is performed, the large intestine is cut and brought to an opening that is made through the wall of the abdomen. This allows bowel contents to empty into a bag. Later, when the repairs to the child’s organs have healed, the colostomy is removed to allow the child to pass normal bowel movements.
Recovery
With treatment, the outcome is usually good. However, it depends on the exact type and severity of the problem. Some infants may never develop adequate bowel control."
Inflammatory bowel disease,"Inflammatory bowel disease is a term that refers to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, two inflammatory conditions that affect as many as 1.6 million Americans, most diagnosed before age 35.
What is IBD?
IBD is the common name used to describe two chronic diseases of the intestinal tract ― Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis ― that cause inflammation in the intestines:
Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus.
Ulcerative colitis can affect any part of the large intestine.
A third category, indeterminate colitis inflammatory bowel disease, refers to IBD that has features of both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. "

A hernia occurs when a section of intestine protrudes through a weakness in the abdominal muscles. A soft bulge is seen underneath the skin where the hernia has occurred.
In children, a hernia usually occurs in 1 of 2 places:
Around the belly button
In the groin area
A hernia that occurs in the belly button area is called an umbilical hernia.
A hernia that occurs in the groin area is called an inguinal hernia.
What causes a hernia?
A hernia can develop in the first few months after the baby is born because of a weakness in the muscles of the abdomen. Inguinal and umbilical hernias happen for slightly different reasons.
What is an inguinal hernia?
An inguinal hernia occurs when part of an internal organ bulges through a weak area of muscle that forms the wall of the abdomen at the groin. This may result in a visible groin bulge or (in males) a bulge or mass within the scrotum. The bulge may hurt or burn at times.
Most inguinal hernias happen because an opening in the muscle wall does not close as it should before birth. That leaves a weak area in the belly muscle. Pressure on that area can cause tissue to push through and bulge out. A hernia can occur soon after birth or much later in life."
Inherited metabolic disorders,"What are inherited metabolic disorders?
Inherited metabolic disorders — also known as inborn errors of metabolism — are heritable, or genetic, disorders. There are hundreds of known inborn errors of metabolism, including albinism, cystinuria and phenylketonuria (PKU).
Symptoms
In young infants, symptoms include apnea, lethargy, poor feeding, tachypnea and vomiting.
Diagnosis
Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of inborn errors of metabolism have improved the outlook for many of these conditions. Laboratory testing for metabolic disorders includes tests for:
Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which is the predominant finding in a number of inborn errors of metabolism
Jaundice or other evidence of liver disease, a sign of another important group of inborn errors of metabolism
Treatment
In the last two decades, enzyme replacement, gene transfer and organ transplantation have shown benefit for many previously untreatable inborn errors of metabolism."
Insomnia,"What is insomnia?
Insomnia, which means difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, is a symptom, not a diagnosis or a disease. It may be due to a lack of sleep or poor quality of sleep.
You’ve probably had nights when you couldn’t fall asleep, no matter how desperately you tried.
When you can't sleep, the ticking of the clock only reminds you of your exhaustion and the endless hours until morning. And perhaps you finally drop off around dawn, only to be jarred awake by the alarm an hour later.
Insomnia is one of the most common sleep complaints. About 1 in 3 adults has bouts of insomnia that last a few days at a time. This is acute insomnia. But 1 in 10 adults suffers ongoing difficulty sleeping, known as chronic insomnia. This is defined as insomnia that occurs more than 3 nights a week for over a month.
Insomnia affects people in different ways. If you suffer from it, you may not be able to go to sleep or you may not be able to stay asleep. You might constantly wake up earlier than you would like, perhaps in the wee hours of the morning, and find yourself unable to go back to sleep. 
Women are more likely to have insomnia than men. It is also more common among shift workers, who don't have consistent sleep schedules; people with low incomes; people who have a history of depression; and those who don't get much physical activity."
Internal tibial torsion,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Internal tibial torsion is one of the possible causes of in-toeing in young children.
Most children outgrow their internal tibial torsion without any treatment.
In rare cases, surgery may be recommended if internal tibial torsion doesn’t improve over time."
Intestinal polyps,"What is an intestinal polyp?
A colorectal polyp is a growth that sticks out of the lining of the colon or rectum. There may be single or multiple polyps. Polyps greater than 1 cm have a greater cancer risk associated with them than smaller polyps. Risk factors include a family history of polyps or colon cancer.
Polyps may also be associated with some hereditary disorders, including:
Gardner's syndrome
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome
Juvenile polyposis
Familial adenomatous polyposis
Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, or HNPCC)
Symptoms 
Colonic polyps in children most commonly present with rectal bleeding.
Diagnosis 
A rectal examination may reveal a polyp that can be felt by the physician. However, the physical exam is usually normal. 
Tests that show polyps:
Sigmoidoscopy: an internal examination of the lower large bowel (colon), using an instrument called a sigmoidoscope
Colonoscopy: an internal examination of the colon (large intestine), using an instrument called a colonoscope
Virtual colonoscopy
Barium enema
Treatment 
Small polyps can be removed with an electrocautery snare passed through a rigid or flexible sigmoidoscope but since total colonoscopy is usually recommended in all patients who have a polyp, it is best to wait and do the polypectomy in a well-prepared colon during that procedure.
Large, fixed, soft, velvety lesions in the rectum are usually villous adenomas. These tumors have a high potential of being malignant and must be excised completely. With the patient anesthetized, this can be accomplished in most instances through the anus.
Pedunculated polyps (those with stalks) and small sessile (non-stalked) lesions in the sigmoid and above should be removed with biopsy forceps or an electrocautery snare passed through the colonoscope.
Depending on your medical history, age and risk factors, your physician will recommend how often to screen for colon cancer, including how often you should perform the fecal occult blood test and how frequently you should have a flexible sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy or other tests performed."
Intraventricular hemorrhage,"What is intraventricular hemorrhage?
Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) of the newborn is bleeding into the fluid-filled areas, or ventricles, surrounded by the brain. The condition is most often seen in premature babies, and the smaller and more premature the infant, the higher the risk for IVH. This is because blood vessels in the brain of premature infants are not yet fully developed and are extremely fragile. IVH is rarely present at birth, and if it occurs, it will usually be in the first several days of life.
The condition is quite rare after one month of age, no matter how early the baby was born. But IVH is more common in premature babies who have had physical stress, such as respiratory distress syndrome, pneumothorax or high blood pressure. The condition may also occur in healthy premature babies who were born without injury. IVH may develop in full-term babies, though it is very uncommon.
Symptoms
There may be no symptoms, though the most common symptoms seen in premature infants include:
Breathing pauses (apnea)
Decreased muscle tone
Decreased reflexes
Excessive sleep
Lethargy
Weak suck
Diagnosis
A routine head ultrasound is recommended for all babies born before 30 weeks. The test is done once between seven and 14 days of age. A second routine ultrasound is suggested close to the time the baby was originally expected to be born. IVH should be considered whenever the baby's health worsens suddenly, especially in the first week of life. A head CT is recommended if a term baby has symptoms after a difficult birth, low blood count or other signs of bleeding problems.
Treatment
There is no current therapy to stop the bleeding. The health care team will keep the infant as stable as possible and treat symptoms as appropriate. For example, a blood transfusion may be given to improve blood pressure and blood count. If hydrocephalus develops, a spinal tap may be done to relieve pressure. If the condition cannot be treated with a spinal tap, surgery may be needed to place a tube or shunt in the brain to drain fluid.
Prognosis
How well the infant does depends on the severity of bleeding and whether hydrocephalus develops. Infants with low grades of bleeding have outcomes similar to premature babies who do not have IVH. More severe IVH may lead to developmental delays and movement problems.
Prevention
Pregnant women who are high risk of delivering early may be given corticosteroids to help reduce the baby's risk for IVH. In certain women who are on medications that affect bleeding risks, vitamin K should be given before delivery."
Iron deficiency,"What is iron-deficiency anemia?
The most common cause of anemia worldwide is iron deficiency. Iron is needed to form hemoglobin, part of red blood cells that carry oxygen and remove carbon dioxide (a waste product) from the body. Iron is mostly stored in the body in the hemoglobin. About one-third of iron is also stored as ferritin and hemosiderin in the bone marrow, spleen, and liver.
What causes iron-deficiency anemia?
Iron-deficiency anemia may be caused by the following:
Diets low in iron. Iron is obtained from foods in our diet; however, only 1 mg of iron is absorbed for every 10 to 20 mg of iron ingested. A person unable to have a balanced iron-rich diet may suffer from some degree of iron-deficiency anemia.
Body changes. An increased iron requirement and increased red blood cell production is required when the body is going through changes, such as growth spurts in children and adolescents, or during pregnancy and lactation.
Gastrointestinal tract abnormalities. Malabsorption of iron is common after some forms of gastrointestinal surgeries. Most of the iron taken in by foods is absorbed in the upper small intestine. Any abnormalities in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract could alter iron absorption and result in iron-deficiency anemia. Surgery or medications that stop stomach acid production will also decrease iron absorption. 
Blood loss. Loss of blood can cause a decrease of iron and result in iron-deficiency anemia. Sources of blood loss may include GI bleeding, menstrual bleeding, or injury.
What are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?
The following are the most common symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Abnormal paleness or lack of color of the skin
Irritability
Lack of energy or tiring easily (fatigue)
Increased heart rate (tachycardia)
Sore or swollen tongue
Enlarged spleen
A desire to eat peculiar substances such as dirt or ice (a condition called pica)
The symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia may resemble other blood conditions or medical problems. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.
How is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?
Iron-deficiency anemia may be suspected from general findings on a complete medical history and physical examination, such as complaints of tiring easily, abnormal paleness or lack of color of the skin, or a fast heartbeat (tachycardia). Iron-deficiency anemia is usually discovered during a medical examination through a blood test that measures the amount of hemoglobin (number of red blood cells) present, and the amount of iron in the blood. In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination, diagnostic procedures for iron-deficiency anemia may include the following:
Additional blood tests for iron
Bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy. A procedure that involves taking a small amount of bone marrow fluid (aspiration) and/or solid bone marrow tissue (called a core biopsy), usually from the hip bones, to be examined for the number, size, and maturity of blood cells and/or abnormal cells. This test is usually not necessary. 
Upper and/or lower endoscopy. These tests may help rule out a source of blood loss.  
Treatment for iron-deficiency anemia
Specific treatment for iron-deficiency anemia will be determined by your doctor based on:
Your age, overall health, and medical history
Extent of the anemia
Cause of the anemia
Your tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the anemia
Your opinion or preference
Treatment may include:
Iron-rich diet. Eating a diet with iron-rich foods can help treat iron-deficiency anemia. Good sources of iron include the following:
Meats, such as beef, pork, lamb, liver, and other organ meats
Poultry, such as chicken, duck, turkey, (especially dark meat), liver
Fish, such as shellfish, including clams, mussels, and oysters, sardines, anchovies
Leafy greens of the cabbage family, such as broccoli, kale, turnip greens, and collards
Legumes, such as lima beans and green peas; dry beans and peas, such as pinto beans, black-eyed peas, and canned baked beans
Yeast-leavened whole-wheat bread and rolls
Iron-enriched white bread, pasta, rice, and cereals
Iron supplements. Iron supplements can be taken over several months to increase iron levels in the blood. Iron supplements can cause irritation of the stomach and discoloration of bowel movements. They should be taken on an empty stomach, or with orange juice, to increase absorption. They are much more effective than dietary interventions alone. In cases of malabsorption or intolerance, IV iron may be needed.
Evaluation for a source of blood loss. This may include upper endoscopy or colonoscopy. 
How does the body process iron?
Iron is present in many foods and absorbed into the body through the stomach. During this process of absorption, oxygen combines with iron and is transported into the plasma portion of blood by binding to transferrin. From there, iron and transferrin are used in the production of hemoglobin, stored in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow, and utilized as needed by all body cells.
The following is a list of foods that are good sources of iron. Always consult your doctor regarding the recommended daily iron requirements for your particular situation.

Irritable bowel syndrome,"Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a digestive disorder that causes abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, gas or a combination of the above. IBS occurs in people of all ages, including children. Some children may have diarrhea as a dominant symptom, while others may have constipation as a dominant symptom. Certain children have symptoms that alternate between diarrhea and constipation. Stress has been implicated as a trigger in IBS, but stress alone does not cause IBS.
Symptoms 
Diarrhea 
Constipation 
Diarrhea alternating with constipation
Flatulence
Bloating
Mucus in the stool
Vomiting 
Nausea 
Weight loss in some children
Urgency with bowel movement
Sensation of incomplete emptying after bowel movement
Diagnosis
To diagnose IBS, the doctor will ask questions about symptoms and examine the child to rule out more serious problems or diseases. IBS is not a disease — it is a syndrome, or group of symptoms that occur together. It does not damage the intestine, so if the physical exam and other tests show no sign of disease or damage, the doctor may diagnose IBS.
Treatment
IBS is usually treated by introducing more fiber into the child’s diet. Bowel training to empty the bowels at regular, specific times during the day may help. In children with constipation, laxatives should be used with caution because they may lead to addiction and compound the problem. When used, laxatives are taken usually short term and parents must follow the doctor’s instructions precisely.
When to Call for Help
Call your pediatrician if your child’s bowel movements change abruptly and the change lasts for more than two weeks, or if your child has pain before and during bowel movement and/or blood in the stool. 
 "
Jaundice,"What is jaundice?
Jaundice, also called icterus, causes your skin and the whites of your eyes to turn yellow. The condition is caused by too much bilirubin, a yellow chemical in hemoglobin (the substance that carries oxygen in your red blood cells). As red blood cells break down, the body builds new cells to replace them. The old ones are processed by the liver, but if the liver cannot handle the blood cells as they break down, bilirubin builds up in the body.
Many healthy babies have some jaundice during the first week of life. It usually goes away, though jaundice can happen at any age and may be a sign of a problem. Other causes of jaundice include:
Blood diseases
Genetic syndromes
Liver diseases like hepatitis or cirrhosis
Blockage of bile ducts
Infections
Medicines
Symptoms
Yellow skin
Yellow sclera (the white part of the eyes)
Diagnosis
Physical examination will show jaundice and possibly liver swelling. Specific tests vary but may include liver function tests to determine how well the liver is working.
Treatment
All jaundice-associated conditions require medical diagnosis and treatment. In some cases, the only treatment needed may be observation, but always consult with your health care provider."
JIA-associated uveitis,"What is JIA-associated uveitis?
Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, the layer between the sclera and the retina. Uveitis can occur spontaneously, or it can be caused by infections or autoimmune diseases in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own tissues and organs — in this case, the uvea. One such disease is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), a type of autoimmune arthritis in children, hence the term JIA-associated uveitis.
If the inflammation is not treated promptly, scarring and vision problems develop, including glaucoma, cataracts and eventually loss of vision. Uveitis can occur during or after JIA, and even after the disease is under control and there aren’t other symptoms.
Symptoms
Uveitis symptoms may not be obvious symptoms, and tend to develop slowly. Sometimes children say the light bothers them or they have blurred vision. If your child has been diagnosed with JIA, it is very important to see a pediatric ophthalmologist regularly and pay attention to the following signs:
Red eyes
Blurred vision
Sensitivity to light
Dark floating spots in the vision
A child may also have other symptoms associated with the autoimmune disease, including joint pain, fever, malaise, fatigue and flu-like symptoms.
Diagnosis
A thorough eye exam is usually needed to diagnose uveitis. Blood tests and X-rays can be used to determine whether another underlying disorder, such as JIA, is causing the condition.
Eye exams include:
Dilated eye exam, during which the retina and optic nerves are examined at a close up for signs of damage using a device called ophthalmoscope
Tonometry, a test that measures the pressure inside the eye
Slit-lamp exam of the structures in the front of the eyes
Treatment
Steroid eye drops to reduce inflammation and swelling for short-term treatment
Oral steroids
Medications that suppress the overactive immune system in JIA
In certain cases, a new class of medications called biologic response modifiers that can keep the immune system in balance
When to Call for Help
If your child has any of the above symptoms, seek advice from your pediatrician. If your child has been diagnosed with JIA, it is very important to see a pediatric ophthalmologist regularly."
Kawasaki disease,"Kawasaki disease is a rare heart condition that causes a high fever and inflammation of the blood vessels. It usually affects children under the age of 5. It is the most common form of acquired (not present at birth) heart disease in children in developed countries. In the U.S., Kawasaki disease affects between 9 and 20 children out of 100,000 each year.
Johns Hopkins Children's Center pediatric cardiologist Benjamin Barnes outlines what you should know about Kawasaki disease.
What is Kawasaki disease? 
Kawasaki disease is a heart condition that develops suddenly. The condition causes the immune system to attack blood vessels, which become inflamed and swollen. Kawasaki disease tends to affect the coronary arteries, which carry blood to the heart muscle. 

Other names for Kawasaki disease are Kawasaki syndrome and mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.
Kawasaki Disease Risk Factors
Known risk factors of Kawasaki disease include:
Age: Kawasaki disease mostly affects children younger than 5.
Sex: Boys are slightly more likely than girls to develop Kawasaki disease.
Ethnicity: Kawasaki disease is more common in people of Asian or Pacific Island descent.
Kawasaki Disease Causes
Experts do not know exactly what causes Kawasaki disease. It is not contagious, so it cannot spread from person to person. It might be the result of changes to certain genes or related to viral or bacterial infections. Infections may cause the immune system to attack the blood vessel walls by mistake and cause inflammation.
Kawasaki Disease Symptoms
The most common symptom of Kawasaki disease in children is a high fever (over 100.4 degrees) that lasts for five days or more. At least four of the following symptoms are also usually present:
“Strawberry tongue,” which is bumps or white spots on the tongue
Peeling skin on the fingers and toes (usually in the second or third week of illness)
Red eyes
Redness and inflammation of the hands and feet
Redness and swelling of the lips, mouth, tongue and throat
Skin rash (see below)
Swollen lymph glands
Kawasaki Disease and Skin Rash
A rash that forms between the chest and leg area or in the genital area is common with Kawasaki disease. This rash is known to go away within one week.
Atypical Kawasaki disease
Some children with Kawasaki disease have a fever with fewer than four of the other typical symptoms. This is known as atypical, or incomplete, Kawasaki disease.
Kawasaki disease and COVID-19
There is not yet a known link between Kawasaki disease and COVID-19. Some children with COVID-19 also develop a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C can cause symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease, including fever and rash. See your child’s health care provider if you notice any of these symptoms."
Kidney stones,"What are kidney stones?
Kidney stones are also known as renal calculi or nephrolithiasis. They typically occur in adults, but can affect children as well and can occur even in babies. Kidney stones form when high amounts of certain substances accumulate in the kidneys, forming crystals or a stone. Certain stones are caused by other diseases but many are related to diet and nutrition. Some doctors note anecdotal evidence that more children are getting this condition, possibly due to too much salt in their diets. 
Types of Kidney Stones
Calcium stones are the most common type, usually caused by high intake of certain substances, such as salt.
Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria, an inherited disorder, marked by increased formation of stones in the bladder, kidney and ureter.
Struvite stones most often occur in women who have urinary tract infections.
Urica acid stones can occur with gout or after chemotherapy.
Symptoms
Intense pain in the lower back and/or in the sides
Frequent, painful urination
Nausea, vomiting
Blood in the urine and/or cloudy urine
Urinary tract infections secondary to kidney stones accompanied by fever
Diagnosis
A test to measure uric acid levels
Urinalysis
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal/kidney MRI
Abdominal X-rays
Kidney ultrasound
Once the stone is found, it should be analyzed to determine what type of stone it is.
Treatment
Most stones pass down the urinary tract on their own and are eventually expelled. Pain relievers, often potent ones, are needed to manage the pain. Increased fluid intake will help the stone to pass. Antibiotics may be given if the stone causes a urinary tract infection Stones that don’t pass need to be removed surgically. Dietary changes and drinking plenty of fluids are recommended to prevent recurrence.
When to Call for Help
If your child shows any signs suggestive of a kidney stone, call your pediatrician."
Klinefelter syndrome,"What is Klinefelter syndrome?
Most men are born with a pair of XY chromosomes, while most females are born with pair of XX chromosomes. Klinefelter syndrome occurs when a male is born with an extra X chromosome. Thus a male with Klinefelter has XXY instead of the usual XY pair. Because males with this condition produce less of the male hormone testosterone than other males, they are less masculine-looking than their peers. The condition usually leads to infertility in adult life. Klinefelter has been linked to increased risk for autoimmune disorders, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, as well as depression and learning disabilities. 
Klinefelter occurs in one out of every 500 to 1,000 newborn males.
Symptoms
Delayed or incomplete sexual development during puberty 
Feminine features 
Underdeveloped external genitalia 
Sparse or absent facial and body hair 
Enlarged breasts 
Learning problems 
Diagnosis
The definitive diagnosis is karyotype testing that shows the extra X chromosome. 
Other tests may include: 
Semen count 
Blood tests to measure the levels of certain sex hormones 
When to Call for Help
If a boy fails to mature sexually during puberty, call your health care provider. 
Treatment
Testosterone therapy can improve many of the signs and symptoms associated with the disorder.
 "
Kyphosis,"What is kyphosis?
A normal spine, when viewed from behind, appears straight. However, a spine affected by kyphosis shows evidence of a forward curvature of the back bones (vertebrae) in the upper back area, giving an abnormally rounded or “humpback” appearance.
Kyphosis is defined as a curvature of the spine measuring 50 degrees or greater on an X-ray, a diagnostic test that uses invisible electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones and organs onto film. The normal spine can bend from 20 to 45 degrees of curvature in the upper back area. Kyphosis is a type of spinal deformity."
Lacerations,"What are lacerations?
A laceration or cut refers to a skin wound. Unlike an abrasion, none of the skin is missing. A cut is typically thought of as a wound caused by a sharp object, like a shard of glass.
Lacerations tend to be caused by blunt trauma.
Symptoms
Although it can be obscured by blood, a cut is one of the easiest medical conditions to diagnose.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is made by physical exam.
Treatment
Treatment involves stopping the bleeding, cleaning and dressing the wound. Deeper cuts may need stitches to stop bleeding and reduce scarring."
Laryngotracheal stenosis,"What is laryngotracheal stenosis?
Laryngotracheal stenosis (LS), a narrowing of the larynx or trachea, is a condition that can occur in infants and children for several reasons. Acquired LS develops as a result of trauma to the larynx and trachea, usually from endotracheal intubation, while congenital LS is a narrowing present at birth. Neck trauma, inhalation burns and prolonged intubation can also lead to LS.
Symptoms
Stridor (noisy breathing)
Feeding problems
Croup, a loud cough that sounds like barking
Recurrent or severe croup
Diagnosis
Physical exam
Imaging tests of the larynx and trachea including neck X-Rays, fluoroscopy and CT scans
Airway endoscopy in the office and in the operating room
Treatment
This condition may require surgical correction if severe.
When to Call for Help
If your child develops any of the symptoms listed above, call your pediatrician."
Legg-Calve-Perthes disease,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Legg-Calve-Perthes is a rare hip condition affecting children younger than 10 years old.
The cause of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is currently unknown.
Children with Legg-Calve-Perthes disease often develop a noticeable limp and may have some pain in the hip, pelvic and upper leg areas.
A physical exam, X-rays and an MRI scan are often used to diagnose Legg-Calve-Perthes disease.
There are medical and surgical treatments for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease, but surgical procedures are often not recommended for children under 6."
Leukemia,"Leukemia is different from most other cancers. Leukemia is cancer that starts in the bone marrow. The bone marrow is where new blood cells are made. Leukemia cells are early forms of blood cells. They are usually white blood cells.
When you have leukemia, your body makes too many blood cells, which are abnormal. Leukemia cells do not usually form tumors, but they can travel with the blood all over the body and reach almost any organ. Thus, leukemia can be present in many different ways, depending on which organs are involved.
Leukemia cells also interfere with the production of other blood cells — usually red blood cells and platelets.

Liver cyst or tumor,"Acute Liver Failure
This alarming syndrome usually occurs in a previously well infant, child or adolescent and can be caused by a number of infectious or metabolic causes and reactions to medication.
Jaundice occurs rapidly, often in concert with gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting and fever.
We are committed to serving children with this disorder as soon as we are notified and work with our emergency transport team, intensive care specialists and if necessary, our pediatric liver surgeons to provide 24-hour care for the best outcome possible for children with this condition.
What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency?
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an inherited disease in which a protein known as A1AT is unable to be released from the liver into the blood in adequate amounts. This causes a deficiency of the A1AT protein in the circulation. A1AT is a specialized protein that blocks the action of other proteins important in inflammation (swelling) and breakdown of tissues in the body. When the A1AT protein is deficient in the circulation, tissue inflammation and tissue damage is more severe, especially in the lungs. The defective A1AT protein that remains in the liver may cause liver inflammation (hepatitis) that can progress to cirrhosis (permanent liver scarring) and liver failure.
A1AT deficiency is quite common, with about 1 in 1,500 to 2,000 people affected. Both parents must be carriers of the genetic defect to have a child with A1AT deficiency. Although carrier parents partially produce the abnormal A1AT protein, they usually have no — or very minimal — symptoms and they may not realize they are partially affected until their child is diagnosed with the condition.
Symptoms
About 10 percent of newborns with liver disease will be diagnosed with A1AT deficiency. Newborns may develop jaundice as part of inflammation of the liver associated with A1AT deficiency. Older children and teens can present with a liver that has been inflamed for a long time, causing scarring (cirrhosis) to develop. Lung disease usually develops only in adulthood. Adults with A1AT deficiency may have difficulties with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), emphysema, chronic bronchitis, asthma, coughing and repeated lung infections.
Diagnosis
Testing is usually done when a child has liver inflammation of uncertain cause or when a family history suggests A1AT liver disease. The standard screening test is to measure the amount of A1AT protein in the circulation. In cases of A1AT deficiency, the serum A1AT level will be low. When a low A1AT level is found, an additional test is usually done to identify the types of abnormal A1AT proteins that are in the circulation. In rare cases, a more detailed analysis of the DNA in the gene may be necessary.
The amount of liver swelling and damage can be assessed by ultrasonography (sonogram) of the abdomen, blood tests of liver inflammation and function and a liver biopsy, where a small piece of liver tissue is obtained and then examined under the microscope to search for changes typical of A1AT deficiency.
Treatment
There is no cure for A1AT deficiency. Therapy involves controlling symptoms and attempting to prevent the development of complications. To protect their lungs, it is very important that the affected person and those around them not smoke. Vaccinations to protect against viruses, such as hepatitis A and hepatitis B, that can further damage the liver should be given. It is difficult to predict how severely a liver will be affected. Liver function tests are followed over time. Some patients may have minimal liver disease during their entire lifetime; however, a small number will eventually require liver transplant.
Cirrhosis or Chronic Liver Failure
Cirrhosis or chronic liver failure can be caused by a number of the liver and biliary diseases listed in Clinical Services or sometimes appear without known cause. Our approach to pediatric patients with this problem is to start with a thorough history and physical examination and nutritional assessment.
We also have a frank discussion with the patient and family about what is involved in the evaluation for a life-saving liver transplant.
Liver Cyst or Tumor
There are multiple benign and malignant malformations or tumors that can occur in the liver of a child.
Our approach begins with a thorough review of medical records and imaging studies. We work closely with our interventional radiologists and surgeons to establish an accurate diagnosis as quickly as possible.
If the diagnosis is a malignant tumor, then we work with the pediatric oncologists and pediatric surgeons to decide the very best approach, which may include chemotherapy, radiation, embolization, surgical removal and/or liver transplantation."
Lung transplantation,"What is a lung transplant?
A lung transplant is surgery done to remove a diseased lung and replace it with a healthy lung from another person. The surgery may be done for one lung or for both. Lung transplants can be done on people of almost all ages from newborns to adults up to age 65 and sometimes even later.
Types of lung transplant procedures include:
Single lung. This is the transplant of one lung.
Double lung. This is the transplant of both lungs.
Bilateral sequential. This is the transplant of both lungs, done one at a time. It’s also called bilateral single.
Heart-lung transplant. This is the transplant of both lungs and the heart taken from a single donor.
Most lungs that are transplanted come from deceased organ donors. This type of transplant is called a cadaveric transplant. Healthy, nonsmoking adults who are a good match may be able to donate part of one of their lungs. The part of the lung is called a lobe. This type of transplant is called a living transplant. People who donate a lung lobe can live healthy lives with the remaining lungs.
Why might I need a lung transplant?
A lung transplant may be advised for someone who:
Has serious lung problems that can’t be improved with any other treatment, and
Has a life expectancy of 12 to 24 months without a transplant
A lung transplant may be needed for the following conditions:
Severe cystic fibrosis (CF). This is an inherited disease that causes problems in the glands that make sweat and mucus. It is ongoing, gets worse over time, and is usually fatal.
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These are lung diseases that can interfere with normal breathing.
Pulmonary hypertension. This is increased blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs.
Heart disease. Heart disease or heart defects that affect the lungs may need a heart-lung transplant.
Pulmonary fibrosis. This is scarring of the lungs.
Other diseases. Other conditions that can cause severe lung damage include sarcoidosis, histiocytosis, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Also, certain hereditary conditions can affect the lungs.
Not all people with these conditions need a lung transplant. A lung transplant is not advised as a treatment for lung cancer. Your healthcare provider may have other reasons to advise a lung transplant.
What are the risks of a lung transplant?
All procedures have some risks. The risks of this procedure may include:
Bleeding
Infection
Blockage of the blood vessels to the new lung(s)
Blockage of the airways
Severe pulmonary edema (fluid in the lung)
Blood clots
Rejection of the new lung(s)
Rejection is major risk of transplant. This is a normal body reaction to a foreign object or tissue. When an organ is transplanted into a person's body, their immune system sees it as a threat and attacks the organ. To allow the transplanted organ to survive in a new body, medicines are used to trick the immune system into not attacking the transplant. The medicines used to prevent or treat rejection have a lot of side effects. The exact side effects will depend on the specific medicines that are taken.
In some cases, a person shouldn’t have a lung transplant. Reasons for this can include:
Current or recurring infection that can’t be treated
Cancer that has spread to other parts of the body (metastatic cancer)
Severe heart problems
Health problems that make the person unable to tolerate surgery
Serious health conditions other than lung disease that won’t get better after transplant
Not being willing or able to stick to all treatment requirements for getting a lung transplant
Your risks may vary depending on your general health and other factors. Ask your healthcare provider which risks apply most to you. Talk with him or her about any concerns you have.
How do I get ready for a lung transplant?
To get a lung from an organ donor who has died, you will first be evaluated by a transplant team. The team may include:
A transplant surgeon
A healthcare provider specializing in the treatment of the lungs (transplant pulmonologist),
One or more transplant nurses
A social worker
A psychiatrist or psychologist
A dietitian
A chaplain
An anesthesiologist
The transplant evaluation process includes:
Psychological and social evaluation. This includes assessing your stress, financial issues, and support by family and other loved ones. These issues can have a major affect the outcome of a transplant.
Blood tests. Blood tests are needed to help find a good donor match. This helps improve the chances that the donor organ will not be rejected.
Diagnostic tests. Tests may be done to check your lungs and your overall health. These tests may include X-rays, ultrasound, CT scans, pulmonary function tests, lung biopsy, and dental exams. Women may also get a Pap test, gynecology evaluation, and a mammogram.
Stopping smoking. Lung transplant recipients who smoke must quit. They must be nicotine-free for several months before being put on the transplant list.
Other preparations. Several immunizations will be given. These are to lessen the chance of infections that can affect the transplanted lung.
The transplant team will consider all information from interviews, your medical history, physical exam, and diagnostic tests in deciding your eligibility for a lung transplant.
Once you have been accepted as a transplant candidate, you will be placed on a waiting list of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS.) Waiting times vary greatly. They depend on which organ(s) you need, your age, your blood type, and the reason for your transplant. People who are unable to wait may be considered for lung transplant from a living donor.
When a donor organ is available from a deceased person, you will be notified and told to come to the hospital right away so you can be prepared for the transplant. If you are getting a lung from a living donor, the transplant can be done at a planned time. The potential donor(s) must have a compatible blood type and be in good health. Psychological tests will be done to be sure the donor is fine with the decision.
Before the transplant:
Your transplant team will explain the procedure to you and give you a chance to ask any questions about the procedure.
You will be asked to sign a consent form that gives your permission to do the surgery. Read the form carefully and ask questions if anything is not clear.
For a cadaver organ transplant, don’t eat or drink as soon as you are told that a lung has become available.
For a planned living transplant, you should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the surgery, most often after midnight.
You may be given a sedative before the procedure to help you relax.
Your healthcare providers may give you other specific instructions to get ready."
Lupus,"Lupus, an autoimmune disorder, can cause inflammation throughout your body, including in your joints, skin, blood vessels and organs, such as the kidneys. While the cause of lupus is unknown, a combination of genetics, hormones and environmental factors are thought to contribute to its presence.
More than 16,000 new cases are reported each year in the United States. Lupus most often affects women but 10 percent of patients are men.
Medications and lifestyle changes can help control inflammation and minimize organ damage.

Lupus nephritis,"What is lupus nephritis?
Lupus nephritis is inflammation of the kidneys caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease in which a misfiring immune system mistakenly attacks the body’s own organs. SLE can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, heart and brain but which organs are involved varies greatly from person to person. The causes of a misfiring immune system are not entirely understood. Infections, hormones, certain medications and genetic factors are suspected. Lupus is more common in adult women of childbearing age but does occur in children as well.
Symptoms
High blood pressure
Dark urine
Flu-like symptoms
Joint pains and aches
Swelling (edema) of the legs, ankles, eyes and hands
Weight gain, caused by water retention when the kidneys do not filter properly
Some people may have few and subtle symptoms or none at all in the early stages of the disease.
Diagnosis
Urinalysis will show blood, protein or both.
Blood tests will show if the kidneys' filtering capacity has decreased.
Blood tests can also show certain types of antibodies that are elevated in people with autoimmune diseases, but some people with lupus may have normal antibody results.
A kidney biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose the nature and extent of the kidney damage caused by lupus.
Treatment
Depending on the test results and biopsy findings, doctors may prescribe immunosuppressive drugs that control the overactive immune system. Corticosteroids may be prescribed.
When to Call for Help
If your child has bloody or foamy urine, joint pains and aches, fever and fatigue, especially if accompanied by swelling of the face, hands and legs, talk to your pediatrician."
Lyme disease,"Lyme disease is an infection caused by the spiral-shaped bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, most commonly spread by a tick bite. The disease takes its name from Lyme, Connecticut, where the illness was first identified in the United States in 1975. There are over 300,000 estimated new cases of Lyme disease in the United States each year.
The symptoms of Lyme disease depend on how long the infection has been present in the body. The first sign of Lyme disease is often an expanding round or oval red ""bullseye"" rash. If left untreated, people may develop neurological symptoms and heart problems, and have an approximately 60 percent chance of developing Lyme arthritis.

Lymphatic malformation,"What is an LM?
Lymphatic malformation (LM) is a relatively uncommon vascular malformation that can occur anywhere on the body. It is most commonly on the head and neck.
The lymphatic system is part of the immune system that protects the body from infection. When we get sick, our immune system fights germs in our bodies to make us healthy again. Just as blood is carried in arteries and veins, lymph travels in our bodies in lymph vessels. The white blood cells in lymph help to fight infection and disease. Lymph vessels are tubes in the body that carry lymph from small bean-shaped glands called lymph nodes to the blood stream. Lymph nodes are found throughout the body and help to filter lymph to remove viruses and bacteria. An LM occurs when lymph vessels form abnormally.
An LM can be at the skin surface, with small bumps filled with clear or blue-purple liquid, or occur as a swelling deep under the skin. They can sometimes ooze, become infected, bleed and swell. Some LMs are deep inside the body and are found when X-rays or imaging are done for other reasons, or for symptoms such as swelling veins.
LM can be made up of macrocysts — large pockets containing lymph — or microcysts, which are very small pockets of lymph. Many LMs have both macrocysts and microcysts.
Infection is the most common complication of LM. Bleeding inside the LM can also occur. Both infection and bleeding can cause LMs to swell and enlarge. If the LM is on an arm or leg, this swelling could make that limb hard to use.
LMs are formed during a baby’s development before birth, but not all LMs are diagnosed at birth. For many people, LMs are first found on imaging studies after an accident or trauma or as a child grows into an adult (during puberty) or during pregnancy.

How are LMs diagnosed?
Most LMs can be diagnosed by a doctor who has seen and treated malformations before. They will likely be able to diagnose a patient based on a physical exam and asking about the patient’s growth and development. 
Most LMs are not passed from parent to child. Nothing that a mother does during pregnancy can cause or prevent these malformations.
If your doctor is concerned that you may have an LM, it is common to order an MRI, which is a scan or picture of the inside of the body. This will help to show the size and location of the LM. Also, an MRI will help doctors see what other important anatomy is near the LM. Anatomy that is close by could be affected by treatment.
An ultrasound is another useful test to diagnose and monitor the LM. It is a good method for young children because it can be done while a child is awake. However, an ultrasound is not as detailed as MRI, and does not provide as much information about nearby anatomy. Occasionally, a CT scan is used to see whether the LM is affecting a bone. A CT scan is like an MRI, except it uses X-rays instead of magnets.
How are LMs treated?
Most LMs grow as the patient grows. LMs can also grow after trauma, during puberty or during pregnancy. Although some LMs can be cured, many cannot be cured with treatment. These patients will need to be treated at different times throughout their life.
Treatment is typically designed to manage the LM to decrease the size and symptoms. Treatment can reduce problems caused by marks left on the skin. A team of doctors who specialize in treating vascular birthmarks will work together to treat an LM.  
An interventional radiologist is a doctor who can read pictures and scans of the body and use these images to treat the LM without cutting the skin. This doctor will play a central role in both diagnosing and treating an LM. Other doctors on the team can include surgeons, hematologists, dermatologists and geneticists.
LMs are benign, which means they are not cancer. If an LM is not causing problems such as pain or loss of function, watchful waiting may be best. However, LMs can slowly expand over time. Once an LM starts causing problems, doctors will start treatment. If an LM is in a sensitive or dangerous area, or if it becomes infected often, doctors may need to treat it right away.
If you are concerned that you or your child may have an LM, you should see a specialist early. Treatment is individualized for each patient. Your doctors will partner with you to make sure you are getting the right treatment at the right time.
Medication for LM Treatment
Many doctors are working on new treatments for LM. A medicine called sirolimus (rapamycin) has worked for some patients. For most vascular anomalies, a combination of treatment methods is best. Your doctor will help you decide where to start. Sirolimus is taken by mouth as pills or as a liquid.
Sirolimus can be compounded at a special pharmacy into an ointment or cream to be applied to the affected skin. Other medicines are being tested to better treat LM. Your doctor will help determine whether these medicines would be safe and helpful for you, considering the location and size of the LM and any symptoms it is causing.
Sclerotherapy for LM
Sclerotherapy is a very useful treatment for LM. A doctor called an interventional radiologist usually performs this treatment. During sclerotherapy, a special medicine is injected using needles placed through the skin into the lymph vessels and cysts within the LM. The medicine injected into the LM damages and destroys the lymph vessels. This causes scars to form inside the abnormal lymph vessels and less lymph will flow through the area.
Sclerotherapy may take several treatments to get the most benefit. Treatments are usually at least six weeks apart. During a sclerotherapy treatment, a doctor will use ultrasound to target the LM, and X-ray imaging to help guide and monitor the treatment. The skin is not cut during these procedures. Only needles are used to deliver the medicine directly into the malformation.
A variety of medicines could be used for sclerotherapy. The fluid that is injected is called a sclerosant. Although many different types of sclerosants can be used, doxycycline (an antibiotic) is used commonly as a sclerosant when treating LM. Your doctor will advise you about which sclerosant is best for your LM.
Your doctor will prepare you for what happens normally after the procedure and for potential problems. For comfort, most patients are put to sleep under general anesthesia during sclerotherapy. Some patients get to go home the day of the procedure. Some stay overnight in the hospital to recover.
Following treatment, there can be swelling, skin irritation, bruising and pain at the treatment site. The most common complication of sclerotherapy is ulceration. This means that a sore or wound, called an ulcer, develops on the skin over the LM. Ulceration happens in less than 5 percent of cases. Your doctor will help you manage an ulcer until it heals.
Though sclerotherapy makes the LM get smaller, LMs can get bigger again over time. Most LMs cannot be cured; instead, they are managed throughout life. Many patients get multiple rounds of treatment throughout their lifetime. The goal is to make symptoms go away as much as possible.
Additional Treatments for LM
Radiofrequency ablation is a treatment sometimes used for LMs inside the mouth. It is usually performed by an interventional radiologist or a special surgeon called an otolaryngologist (a doctor who specializes in disorders of the ear, nose and throat).
Other therapies, such as cryoablation (freezing therapy), are currently being studied to see whether they are useful for treating lymphatic malformation.
Some patients may get surgery after sclerotherapy. Surgery can remove a mass, extra skin or a visible mark left by the LM. If an LM is not a good candidate for sclerotherapy — usually if the cysts are too small (microcysts) — surgery may be the first treatment offered.
However, the LM will often return after surgery. It is very difficult to entirely remove an LM with surgery. Surgery should be done by a surgeon with experience in treating these complicated malformations."
Malabsorption,"What is malabsorption?
Malabsorption is difficulty in the digestion or absorption of nutrients from food. Malabsorption can affect growth and development, or it can lead to specific illnesses.
Some of the causes of malabsorption include:
Cystic fibrosis (the number one cause in the United States)
Chronic pancreatitis
Lactose intolerance
Celiac disease 
Whipple disease
Shwachman-Diamond syndrome (a genetic disease affecting the pancreas and bone marrow)
Cow's milk protein intolerance
Soy milk protein intolerance
Biliary atresia 
Abetalipoproteinemia
Vitamin B-12 malabsorption may be due to:
Diphyllobothrium latum infestation
Juvenile pernicious anemia
Parasites
Giardia lamblia
Strongyloides stercoralis
Necator americanus (hookworm)
Symptoms
Symptoms of malabsorbtion include:
Avoiding specific foods
Chronic diarrhea 
Bloating and gas
Growth failure  
Diagnosis and Treatment 
Diagnosis and treatment will depend on the specific disease causing the malabsorption."
Malaria,"What is malaria?
A parasite causes malaria. A bite from an infected Anopheles mosquito passes the parasite to humans. These mosquitoes are found in the tropics and subtropics in almost all countries. Nearly all cases of malaria in the U.S. occur in people who have traveled to other countries. Treatment removes the parasite from the blood.
After the parasites enter the body by a mosquito bite, they disappear from the circulating blood within an hour and gather in the liver. After several days, infected red blood cells (RBCs) emerge from the liver and infect other RBCs.
What causes malaria?
If you are bitten by a Plasmodium-infected Anopheles mosquito, you can get malaria. Several different species of Plasmodium can infect mosquitos. Some species cause more serious problems than others do. One species in particular can be life threatening and may cause liver and kidney failure. Another can remain dormant in the liver for many months or years.
Who is at risk for malaria?
The risk of getting malaria depends on:
Your destination
Duration of your travel
Place where you will spend the evenings and nights. (Anopheles mosquitoes bite most often during nighttime hours from dusk to dawn.)
What are the symptoms of malaria?
Early stages of malaria may be similar to the flu. These are the most common symptoms of malaria:
Fever
Chills
Headache
Muscle ache
Fatigue
Nausea
Sometimes vomiting, diarrhea, and coughing
Symptoms of malaria usually appear from 7 to 30 days after the mosquito bite. However, malaria can develop as early as 6 to 8 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito or as late as several months after leaving an area where there is malaria.
Always consult your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is malaria diagnosed?
Along with a complete medical history and physical exam, you may also have blood tests to rule out other possible infections. Using a microscope, your doctor can view malaria parasites in the blood to confirm the diagnosis.
How is malaria treated?
Your healthcare provider can determine specific treatment for malaria based on:
How old you are
Your overall health and medical history
How sick you are
How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Treatment in the early stages is most effective. Delaying treatment can have serious consequences. Treatment for malaria will vary depending on which specific species of Plasmodium you were infected with and the severity of the disease.
Treatment involves taking medicines that kill the parasite in the blood.
What are the complications of malaria?
Complications of malaria are more common with falciparum malaria, which is the most potentially life threatening. People with severe falciparum malaria may develop liver and kidney failure, convulsions, and coma.
Can malaria be prevented?
You can prevent malaria by using antimalarial drugs and taking measures against mosquito bites. This includes such as using mosquito nets when sleeping at night and insect repellent during the day.
Medicines
When planning to travel to an area where malaria occurs, talk with your healthcare provider well in advance of your trip. He or she can prescribe medicine to prevent malaria. But, travelers to different countries may have different recommendations. Travelers visiting cities or rural areas where there is no risk of malaria may not need preventive drugs. You'll need to have an exact itinerary so your doctor can determine what treatment you need.
There are several medicines to prevent malaria in travelers. Determining which medicine is best depends on several factors, such as your medical history and the amount of time before your trip. For treatment to be effective, you must take the medicine exactly as prescribed. And, you must start these medicines before you arrive at your destination and continue them for a specific number of days or weeks after your return, depending on which medicine is prescribed.
Protection from mosquitoes
Be aware that you are still at risk for malaria even with the use of protection.
To avoid mosquito bites, the CDC recommends the following:
Apply insect repellent to exposed skin. The recommended repellent contains 20% to 35% N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET).
Wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants if you are outdoors at night.
Use a mosquito net over the bed if your bedroom is not air-conditioned or screened. For additional protection, treat the mosquito net with the insecticide permethrin.
Spray an insecticide or repellent on clothing, as mosquitoes may bite through thin clothing.
Spray pyrethrin or a similar insecticide in your bedroom before going to bed.
Note: According to the CDC, vitamin B and ultrasound devices do not prevent mosquito bites. Important, current information about prevention and precautions is available online at www.cdc.gov/malaria.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
If you become ill with a fever during or after travel in a malaria risk area, seek prompt medical attention and tell your healthcare providers of your recent travel. Don’t assume you have the flu or some other disease without having a lab test to determine if the symptoms are caused by malaria.
Key points about malaria
Malaria is a disease caused by a Plasmodium species parasite. A bite from an infected Anopheles mosquito transmits the parasite to humans.
Nearly all cases of malaria in the U.S. are in people who have traveled internationally.
Early symptoms of malaria may be similar to the flu.
If you become ill with a fever during or after travel in a malaria risk area, seek prompt medical attention and tell your healthcare providers of your recent travel history."
Malnutrition,"What is malnutrition?
Malnutrition is the condition that develops when the body is deprived of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients it needs to maintain healthy tissues and organ function.
Malnutrition occurs in people who are either undernourished or overnourished. In the United States, more children suffer from malnutrition due to dietary imbalances than due to nutritional deficiencies.
Undernutrition occurs when not enough essential nutrients are consumed or when they are excreted more rapidly than they can be replaced. Overnutrition occurs in people who eat too much, eat the wrong things, don't exercise enough or take too many vitamins or other dietary replacements. Risk of overnutrition is increased by being more than 20 percent overweight or consuming a diet high in fat and salt.
About 1 percent of children in the United States suffer from chronic malnutrition.
Symptoms 
Malnourished children may be short for their age, thin or bloated, listless and have weakened immune systems. Nutritional disorders can affect any system in the body and the senses of sight, taste and smell. They may also produce anxiety, changes in mood and other psychiatric symptoms.
Other symptoms include:
Pale, thick and dry skin
Bruising easily
Rashes
Changes in skin pigmentation
Thin hair that is tightly curled and pulls out easily
Achy joints 
Bones that are soft and tender
Gums that bleed easily
Tongue that may be swollen or shriveled and cracked
Night blindness
Increased sensitivity to light and glare
Diagnosis 
Overall appearance, behavior, body fat distribution and organ function can alert a physician to the presence of malnutrition. Patients may be asked to record what they eat during a specific period. X-rays can determine bone density and reveal gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as heart and lung damage.
Blood and urine tests are used to measure the patient's levels of vitamins, minerals and waste products.
Treatment 
Patients who cannot or will not eat or who are unable to absorb nutrients taken by mouth may be fed intravenously (parenteral nutrition) or through a tube inserted into the gastrointestinal tract (enteral nutrition). Tube feeding is often used to provide nutrients to patients who have suffered burns or who have inflammatory bowel disease. This procedure involves inserting a thin tube through the nose and carefully guiding it along the throat until it reaches the stomach or small intestine. If long-term tube feeding is necessary, the tube may be placed directly into the stomach or small intestine through an incision in the abdomen."
Malrotation,"What is a malrotation or volvulus?
Intestinal malrotation is a condition that is congenital (present at birth) and results from a problem in the normal formation of the fetal intestines. There is a disruption in the usual steps that the intestines follow to arrive at the correct position within the abdomen. Malrotation causes the parts of the intestine to settle in the wrong part of the abdomen, which can cause them to become blocked or to twist.
Intestinal volvulus is a condition in which the bowel becomes twisted, which may be the result of malrotation. Twisted intestines may become blocked (obstructed) or may become injured when the twisting cuts off the intestine’s blood supply. If the blood supply is cut off for a prolonged period, some or all of the intestine may die, which can be fatal. Volvulus is therefore an emergency that requires immediate surgical treatment.
Malrotation of the bowel during fetal development may predispose infants to volvulus, although volvulus can occur in the absence of malrotation. Volvulus associated with malrotation often occurs early in life, frequently in the first year.
Symptoms  
Symptoms of volvulus develop quickly and are generally dramatic enough that infants are taken early to the emergency room, which can be critical for survival.
Abdominal tenderness or distention (swelling of the belly)
Nausea or vomiting 
Vomiting dark green fluid or green-stained material (also called bilious vomiting)
Bloody or dark red stool 
Constipation or difficulty expelling stools
Shock
Diagnosis
Blood in stool
An upper GI X-ray
A CT scan
A barium enema
Blood tests
Treatment 
Emergency surgery to repair the volvulus is necessary. An incision is made in the abdomen, the bowels are inspected and the volvulus is reduced. This means that the bowels are untwisted and the blood supply restored.
If a small segment of bowel is dead from lack of blood flow, it is resected (removed). Depending on the condition of the child at the time of the operation, the ends of the bowels will either be sewn back together or temporarily diverted. Diversion is a process to move stool out of the abdomen through a colostomy or ileostomy and away from tissues that are healing.
When a colostomy is performed, the cut end of the large intestine is brought to an opening that is made through the wall of the abdomen. When an ileostomy is performed, the cut end of the small bowel is brought through a similar opening. Both a colostomy and an ileostomy allow bowel contents to empty into a bag. Later, when the child’s organs have healed, the colostomy is removed in a separate procedure to allow the child to pass normal bowel movements."
Meconium aspiration syndrome,"What is meconium aspiration syndrome?
Meconium is the first feces, or stool, of the newborn. Meconium aspiration syndrome occurs when a newborn breathes a mixture of meconium and amniotic fluid into the lungs around the time of delivery. Meconium aspiration syndrome, a leading cause of severe illness and death in the newborn, occurs in about 5 percent to 10 percent of births. It typically occurs when the fetus is stressed during labor, especially when the infant is past its due date.
Symptoms
Bluish skin color in the infant
Breathing problems
Dark, greenish staining or streaking of the amniotic fluid or the obvious presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid
Limpness in infant at birth
Diagnosis
Before birth, the fetal monitor may show a slow heart rate.
At birth, meconium can be seen in the amniotic fluid. The most accurate test to check for possible meconium aspiration involves looking for meconium staining on the vocal cords with a laryngoscope.
Abnormal breath sounds, especially coarse, crackly sounds, are heard through a stethoscope.
A blood gas analysis shows low blood acidity, decreased oxygen and increased carbon dioxide.
A chest X-ray may show patchy or streaky areas on the lungs.
Treatment
The newborn's mouth should be suctioned as soon as the head can be seen during delivery. Further treatment is necessary if there is thick meconium staining and fetal distress. The infant may be placed in the special care nursery or newborn intensive care unit. Other treatments may include:
Antibiotics to treat infection
Breathing machine to keep the lungs inflated
Use of a warmer to maintain body temperature
Tapping on the chest to loosen secretions
If there have been no signs of fetal distress during pregnancy and the baby is a vigorous full-term newborn, experts recommend against deep suctioning of the windpipe for fear of causing a certain type of pneumonia.
Prognosis
In most cases, the outlook is excellent and there are no bad side effects. In more severe cases, breathing problems may occur, though they generally go away in two to four days. However, rapid breathing may persist for days. An infant with severe aspiration who requires a breathing machine may have a more guarded outcome. Lack of oxygen in the uterus or from complications of meconium aspiration may lead to brain damage. Meconium aspiration rarely leads to permanent lung damage."
Meningitis,"What is meningitis?
Meningitis is an infection that causes inflammation of the membranes (the meninges) covering the brain and spinal cord.
Bacterial meningitis is a true medical emergency that may result in death or brain injury even if treated. Bacterial strains that cause meningitis include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Neisseria meningitides (meningococcus), Listeria monocytogenes and many other types of bacteria.
Viral meningitis is usually not serious, and symptoms should disappear within a few weeks. It usually develops in the late summer and early fall. Seventy percent of the infections occur in children under the age of five.
Symptoms   
Fever and chills
Severe headache
Nausea and vomiting
Stiff neck
Sensitivity to light
Mental status changes
Bulging fontanelles (the soft spots in a baby's skull may bulge)
Poor feeding or irritability in children
Diagnosis
Diagnosing meningitis may require:
Lumbar puncture
Gram stain and culture of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)
Chest X-ray to look for other sites of infection
Head CT scan to look for hydrocephalus, abscess or deep swelling
Note: Because meningitis is an important cause of fever in newborns, a lumbar puncture is often done on newborns who have a fever of uncertain origin.
Treatment 
Acute bacterial meningitis requires immediate hospital-based treatment and antibiotics. Secondary symptoms such as brain swelling, shock and seizures will require other medications and intravenous fluids. Antibiotics are ineffective against viral meningitis — its symptoms should clear up in a few weeks.

Metatarsus adductus,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
In metatarsus adductus, the front part of a child’s foot turns inward.
There is no known cause of metatarsus adductus.
Metatarsus adductus is a very common foot condition in children.
Most cases of metatarsus adductus resolve without treatment."
Microscopic polyangiopathy,"What is microscopic polyangiopathy?
Microscopic polyangiopathy describes small vessel, systemic vasculitis.
Treatment
Treatment includes steroids, antiplatelet agents and a cytotoic agent, usually cyclophosphamide."
Mitochondrial hepatopathies,"What are mitochondrial hepatopathies?
Mitochondrial hepatopathies are a special group of liver diseases related to a problem with the way mitochondria are functioning. This leads to damage or poor function of the liver.
There are two main types of mitochondrial hepatopathies. In respiratory chain disorders, the mitochondria don't make enough energy. This is because the tools in the mitochondria did not form completely and are not able to do their job correctly. In fatty acid oxidation defects, the mitochondria are unable to turn fats into energy. Mitochondria need several enzymes (proteins) to change fat into energy. In this type of disorder, the mitochondria are missing some of those enzymes. This means they can't turn the fats we eat into energy."
MRSA infection,"What is an MRSA infection?
MRSA stands for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Patients with MRSA are infected with a strain of Staph aureus bacteria resistant to antibiotics known as beta-lactams, such as methicillin, amoxicillin and penicillin. MRSA has two classifications: community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) and hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA).
Diagnosis
Your doctor may recommend the following tests:
A skin biopsy and culture from the infected site
Culture of the drainage (fluid) from the infection, to see which organism grows in it
Blood culture
Treatment
For a local skin MRSA infection, draining the abscess at the doctor's office is usually the only treatment needed. Few antibiotics are available to treat more serious MRSA infections. These include vancomycin (Vancocin, Vancoled), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Bactrim DS, Septra, Septra DS) and linezolid (Zyvox).
It is important to finish all doses of antibiotics you have been given, even if you feel better before the final dose. Unfinished doses can lead to development of drug resistance in the bacteria."
Muscular dystrophy,Muscular dystrophy causes the muscles in the body to become very weak. The muscles break down and are replaced with fatty deposits over time.
Myalgia,"What is myalgia?
Myalgia describes muscle aches and pain, which can involve ligaments, tendons and fascia, the soft tissues that connect muscles, bones and organs. Injuries, trauma, overuse, tension, certain drugs and illnesses can all bring about myalgia.
Symptoms
Muscle cramps
Joint pain
Diagnosis
Diagnosis requires careful clinical evaluations of muscle cramps and joint pain.
Treatment
To ease muscle pain due to overuse or injury, rest the body part and take acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Applying ice within the first 24 to 72 hours of an injury can reduce pain and inflammation. After than, heat can be more soothing. Muscle pain from overuse and fibromyalgia respond well to massage and gentle stretching exercises. If pain persists more than three days or the pain is severe and unexplained or there’s any sign of infection, call the doctor for specialized care and possibly medications."
Myopia,"What is myopia?
Myopia, also known as nearsightedness, is a common refractive error where distant objects appear out of focus. Nearsightedness occurs either because the eyeball is too long, or because the eye’s refractive power is too strong due to the shape of the cornea (lens) inside the eye."
Narcolepsy,"What is narcolepsy?
Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder caused by the brain's inability to regulate sleep-wake cycles normally. At various times throughout the day, people with narcolepsy experience fleeting urges to sleep. If the urge becomes overwhelming, individuals will fall asleep for periods lasting from a few seconds to several minutes. In some cases, people may remain asleep for an hour or longer."
Nasal obstruction,"What is nasal obstruction?
Nasal obstruction is not a disease but rather a symptom of an underlying disorder that causes the nasal passages to be blocked or obstructed.
In children, some of the most common causes include enlarged adenoids and nasal allergies. Less common causes of nasal blockages are nasal polyps, tumors and congenital malformations of the nose.
Symptoms of Nasal Obstruction
“Nasally” voice
Nasal drainage
Breathing through the mouth most of the time
Recurrent sinus infections
Diagnosing Nasal Obstruction
Nasal exam, including the use of endoscopes, X-rays, CT scans and/or other imaging tests
Allergy testing, when indicated
Treatment of Nasal Obstruction
Medications(steroids and/or antibiotics)
Surgery
When to Call for Help

Nausea is the sensation of having to vomit or having the urge to vomit. Vomiting may or may not occur as a result of nausea. Some describe the sensation of nausea as unsettled feeling in the stomach or queasiness. Nausea is not a disease but a symptom of a variety of conditions, ranging from viral and bacterial infections to motion sickness, to food poisoning, to abscesses of the brain. Certain medications can cause nausea.
Symptoms
Nausea can occur with or without vomiting. Depending on the cause, nausea may be accompanied by diarrhea, malaise and fever.
Diagnosis
If a child has nausea, it is essential to find the underlying cause of the symptom. Physical exam and blood tests are usually the first steps. Additional tests and procedures may be needed depending on the findings from the physical exam and the blood analysis.
Treatment 
Because nausea is a symptom rather than a condition, treatment depends on the underlying cause. 
When to Call for Help
Call your pediatrician if your child’s nausea is accompanied by vomiting that doesn’t go away after 24 hours, if the nausea persists or if the child complains of stomach pains or a headache and stiff neck. Nausea and/or vomiting with pain in the lower right corner of the abdomen may mean that your child has appendicitis, an inflammation of the appendix, which usually requires prompt surgical removal. Severe headache with stiff neck and nausea or vomiting can be symptoms of meningitis. "
Necrotizing enterocolitis,"What is Necrotizing Enterocolitis?
Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is the death of intestinal tissue. Primarily affecting premature infants or sick newborns, it occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies and the tissue falls off. Although the cause for this disorder is unknown, it is thought that a decrease in blood flow to the bowel keeps the bowel from producing mucus that protects the gastrointestinal tract. Bacteria in the intestine may also be a cause. Those with a higher risk for this condition include:
Premature infants
Infants who are fed concentrated formulas
Infants in a nursery where an outbreak has occurred
Infants who have received blood exchange transfusions"
Neonatal conjunctivitis,"What is conjunctivitis in children?
Conjunctivitis or pink eye is an irritation of the conjunctiva of the eye. The conjunctiva is the membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids. It also covers the actual eye.
What causes conjunctivitis in children?
There are many different causes of this problem. The following are the most common causes:
Bacteria
Viruses
Chemicals used in medicines for the eye
Allergies
Conjunctivitis is usually divided into at least two categories: newborn conjunctivitis and childhood conjunctivitis. Each has different causes and treatments.
Newborn
The following are the most common causes for the conjunctivitis in newborns:
Infection from the gonorrhea virus passed on during childbirth
Infection from Chlamydia passed on during childbirth
Reaction to chemicals in eye drops
Other bacterial causes
Children
This is a very common problem in children. Also, large outbreaks of conjunctivitis are often seen in day cares and schools. These are the most common causes:
Bacteria
Viruses
Allergies
Herpes infection
What are the symptoms of conjunctivitis in children?
The following are the most common symptoms of the condition. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Gritty feeling in one or both eyes
Itchy, irritated eyes
Clear, thin drainage and increased tearing
Sneezing and runny nose
Stringy discharge from the eyes
Thick, green drainage from the eyes
Ear infection
Lesion with a crusty appearance
Eyes that are matted together in the morning
Swelling of the eyelids
Pink or red discoloration of the whites of one or both eyes
Discomfort when the child looks at a light
Burning in the eyes
The symptoms of conjunctivitis sometimes look like other medical problems. Always see your child’s health care provider for a diagnosis.
How is conjunctivitis in children diagnosed?
Conjunctivitis is usually diagnosed based on a complete medical history and physical examination of your child’s eye. Cultures of the eye drainage are usually not required. However, cultures may be done to help confirm the cause of the infection.
How is conjunctivitis in children treated?
Your child’s health care provider will figure out the best treatment for your child based on:
How old your child is
His or her overall health and medical history
How sick he or she is
How well you can handle specific medications, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
The symptoms of conjunctivitis sometimes look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see your child’s health care provider for a diagnosis.

Infection can spread from one eye to the other. It can also spread to other people by touching the affected eye or drainage from the eye. Proper hand washing is very important. Also avoid touching your eyes with your hands, change pillowcases often, and do not reuse tissues or hand towels on your face. Drainage from the eye is contagious for 24 to 48 hours after starting treatment.
The condition will be treated based on its cause. Treatment can include:
Allergy drops for the eye
Antibiotic drops for the eye
Pills
What are the complications of conjunctivitis in children?
The condition usually does not have long-term complications. However, herpes can cause a serious type of infections. It may result in scarring of the eye and loss of vision if it is not treated properly right away.
When should I call my child’s healthcare provider?
If your child’s symptoms get worse or your child has new symptoms, call your child’s healthcare provider.
Key points about conjunctivitis in children
Conjunctivitis is an inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eye
Conjunctivitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, chemicals, or allergies

Next steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child’s health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your child’s provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Nephrolithiasis,"What are kidney stones?
Kidney stones are also known as renal calculi or nephrolithiasis. They typically occur in adults, but can affect children as well and can occur even in babies. Kidney stones form when high amounts of certain substances accumulate in the kidneys, forming crystals or a stone. Certain stones are caused by other diseases but many are related to diet and nutrition. Some doctors note anecdotal evidence that more children are getting this condition, possibly due to too much salt in their diets. 
Types of Kidney Stones
Calcium stones are the most common type, usually caused by high intake of certain substances, such as salt.
Cystine stones can form in people who have cystinuria, an inherited disorder, marked by increased formation of stones in the bladder, kidney and ureter.
Struvite stones most often occur in women who have urinary tract infections.
Urica acid stones can occur with gout or after chemotherapy.
Symptoms
Intense pain in the lower back and/or in the sides
Frequent, painful urination
Nausea, vomiting
Blood in the urine and/or cloudy urine
Urinary tract infections secondary to kidney stones accompanied by fever
Diagnosis
A test to measure uric acid levels
Urinalysis
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal/kidney MRI
Abdominal X-rays
Kidney ultrasound
Once the stone is found, it should be analyzed to determine what type of stone it is.
Treatment
Most stones pass down the urinary tract on their own and are eventually expelled. Pain relievers, often potent ones, are needed to manage the pain. Increased fluid intake will help the stone to pass. Antibiotics may be given if the stone causes a urinary tract infection Stones that don’t pass need to be removed surgically. Dietary changes and drinking plenty of fluids are recommended to prevent recurrence.
When to Call for Help
If your child shows any signs suggestive of a kidney stone, call your pediatrician."
Neurofibromatosis,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a term that describes three genetic diseases caused by mutations in genes that lead to increased risk of developing tumors. 
Different types of neurofibromatosis lead to growth of different tumors (neurofibromas and schwannomas) in various parts of the body.
Doctors diagnose NF based on the patient’s family history, imaging studies, certain signs and symptoms, and sometimes genetic testing.
Treatments are available to manage neurofibromatosis symptoms, but a cure is not available.  "
Neutrophil disorders,"What is a neutrophil disorder?
A neutrophil is a type of white blood cell, one of the chief cells that fight infection. Neutrophils are made in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream wherever they are needed.
Normally, a serious bacterial infection causes the body to produce an increased number of neutrophils, resulting in a higher than normal white blood cell count. But, if there is a disorder in the neutrophil — in their makeup or number — they can’t do their job. Neutrophil disorders include neutropenia, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome and cyclic neutropenia."
Nevi,"What are birthmarks?
Birthmarks are areas of discolored and/or raised skin that are apparent at birth or within a few weeks of birth. Birthmarks are made up of malformed pigment cells or blood vessels.
Although the cause of birthmarks is not known, most of them are benign (noncancerous) and do not require treatment. Babies with birthmarks should be examined and diagnosed by a health care provider.
What are the most common types of vascular birthmarks?
The following are the most common types of vascular birthmarks:
Macular stains or salmon patches. These are characterized by pink to red marks that may appear anywhere on the body. Angel kisses and stork bites are the most common type of vascular birthmark:
Angel's kisses. Marks located on the forehead, nose, upper lip, and eyelids that usually disappear with age.
Stork bites. Marks on the back of the neck that usually disappear with age.
Hemangioma. A common vascular birthmark. Hemangiomas become visible within the first few weeks or months of life and continue to grow rapidly for about 6 to 9 months. Then, they gradually lose this red color and also shrink. They are called strawberry patch hemangiomas. By age 5, 50% resolve and 90% resolve by age 9 without any treatment. Hemangiomas that grow into other organs or structures or become ulcerated should be evaluated by your health care provider.
Port-wine stain (also called nevus flammeus). A port-wine stain is a flat, pink, red, or purple mark that appears at birth, often on the face, arms, and legs, and continues to grow as the child grows. Port-wine stains do not go away and often need treatment if located on the eyelid or forehead. Port-wine stains involving the face may cause eye problems and be associated with other developmental disorders.
What are the most common types of pigmented birthmarks?
The following are the most common types of pigmented birthmarks:
Moles (also known as congenital nevi). These can be skin-colored, brown, or black, flat or raised and small or large. They can happen anywhere on the body. Moles can also happen in adulthood, but only moles that are present at birth are considered birthmarks. Other nevi that behave like congenital nevi can appear within the first 2 years of life. Congenital nevi can develop into cancer later in life, with larger nevi having a higher risk of becoming cancerous.
Cafe-au-lait spots. This is French for coffee with milk. These are usually oval-shaped and light brown or black. Typically these fade with age and are not a problem. However, many of them grouped together can be a sign of other health issues and should be examined by a health care provider. 
Mongolian spots. These are blue or blue-gray spots on the lower back or buttocks. They are most common in babies with darker skin, like African-American or Asian babies. They can be mistaken for bruises and they usually fade with age.  "
Night terrors,"What is snoring? 
Whether you call it sawing logs, or by its medical name, stertor, snoring is common. Snoring occurs when something blocks the flow of air through your mouth and nose, resulting in sounds caused by tissues at the top of your airway striking each other and vibrating.
Symptoms 
Snoring can also be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea, in which the person stops breathing for periods of more than 10 seconds at a time during sleep. Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include inattention, hyperactivity, sleepiness or other behavioral problems. If your child snores frequently, have your health care provider check for sleep apnea. In children, obstructive sleep apnea often occurs in association with large tonsils.
Diagnosis 
Heavy snorers, those who snore in any position or are disruptive to the family, should seek medical advice to ensure that sleep apnea is not a problem. The physician will conduct a thorough examination of the nose, mouth, throat, palate and neck. A sleep study may be necessary to determine how serious the snoring is and what effects it has on the snorer’s health.
Treatment 
Treatments include surgery for obstructive sleep apnea and snoring. If surgery is too risky or unwanted, the patient may sleep every night with a nasal mask that delivers air pressure into the throat — this is called continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. Patients can also reduce snoring by losing weight, cutting down or eliminating alcohol and other sedatives at bedtime and avoiding sleeping flat on their backs.
 "
Nocturnal seizures,"What are nocturnal seizures? 
Nocturnal or sleep-related seizures, a form of epilepsy, can cause abnormal movement or behavior during sleep.
Symptoms 
Nocturnal seizures may range from awakening for no clear reason, sometimes multiple times a night, to shouting, screaming and violent movements of the arms and legs. Patients may also thrash around or act confused.
Diagnosis 
If you suspect that your child may have nocturnal seizures, see a physician, neurologist or sleep specialist. An overnight sleep study with video monitoring may be recommended.
Treatment 
Nocturnal seizures often can be controlled with anticonvulsant medication."
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,"Fatty liver disease means that you have fat inside your liver that can, over time, affect liver function and cause liver injury. People who drink too much alcohol may also have fat in their liver, but that condition is different from fatty liver disease.
Types of fatty liver disease
Health care providers divide fatty liver disease into two types. If you just have fat but no damage to your liver, the disease is called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). If you have fat in your liver plus signs of inflammation and liver cell damage, the disease is called nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
About 10% to 20% of Americans have NAFLD. About 2% to 5% have NASH.
Symptoms
Fatty liver disease is sometimes called a silent liver disease. This is because it can happen without causing any symptoms. Most people with NAFLD live with fat in their liver without developing liver damage. A few people who have fat in their liver develop NASH.
If you have NASH, you may have symptoms that could take years for them to develop. If liver damage from NASH leads to permanent scarring and hardening of your liver, this is called cirrhosis.  
Symptoms from NASH may include:
Severe tiredness
Weakness
Weight loss
Yellowing of the skin or eyes
Spiderlike blood vessels on the skin
Long-lasting itching
NASH that turns into cirrhosis could cause symptoms like fluid retention, internal bleeding, muscle wasting, and confusion. People with cirrhosis over time may develop liver failure and need a liver transplant.
Who's at risk
Health care providers don’t know the exact cause of fatty liver disease. But they think that obesity is the most common cause. Obesity in the U.S. has doubled in the last decade, and health care providers are seeing a steady rise in fatty liver disease. Although children and young adults can get fatty liver disease, it is most common in middle age. 
Risk factors include:
Being overweight
Having high blood fat levels, either triglycerides or LDL (“bad”) cholesterol
Having diabetes or prediabetes
Having high blood pressure
Diagnosis
Fatty liver disease can happen without causing any symptoms. It’s usually diagnosed when you have routine blood tests to check your liver. Your health care provider may suspect fatty liver disease with abnormal test results, especially if you are obese.
Imaging studies of your liver may show fat deposits. Some imaging tests, including special ultrasound and MRI scans can help diagnose the disease and spot scar tissue in the liver. But the only way to be certain that fatty liver disease is the only cause of liver damage is with a liver biopsy. A liver biopsy involves getting a tissue sample of your liver with a needle. The needle removes a small piece of liver tissue that can be looked at under a microscope. Here’s how your health care provider makes the diagnosis:
If you have fat but no inflammation or tissue damage, the diagnosis is NAFLD.
If you have fat, inflammation, and liver damage, the diagnosis is NASH.
If you have a type of scar tissue in your liver called fibrosis, you may be developing cirrhosis.
Treatment
If you have NAFLD without any other medical problems, you don’t need any special treatment. But making some lifestyle changes can control or reverse the fat buildup in your liver. These may include:
Losing weight
Lowering your cholesterol and triglycerides
Controlling your diabetes
Avoiding alcohol
If you have NASH, no medication is available to reverse the fat buildup in your liver. In some cases, the liver damage stops or even reverses itself. But in others, the disease continues to progress. If you have NASH, it’s important to control any conditions that may contribute to fatty liver disease. Treatments and lifestyle changes may include:
Losing weight
Medication to reduce cholesterol or triglycerides
Medication to reduce blood pressure
Medication to control diabetes
Limiting OTC drugs
Avoiding alcohol
Seeing a liver specialist
Some medications are being studied as possible treatments for NASH. These include antioxidants like vitamin E. Scientists are also studying some new diabetes medications for NASH that may be given even if you don't have diabetes. However, you should only take these medicines after consulting with a liver specialist.
Complications
The main complication of fatty liver disease is the progression of NASH to cirrhosis. Cirrhosis means permanent scarring and hardening of the liver.
When to call the health care provider
If you've been diagnosed with any fatty liver disease, let your health care provider know if you have any symptoms that mean the disease is getting worse. These include fatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, fluid retention, or bleeding.
Living with fatty liver disease
If you are living with fatty liver disease, learn as much as you can about your condition and work closely with your medical team. Since many medications can harm your liver, always let all your health care providers know about any medications you are taking. These include OTC drugs, dietary supplements, and vitamins. Other ways to manage fatty liver disease include maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, getting regular exercise, and continuing to avoid alcohol."
Nutritional deficiencies,"What are nutritional deficiencies?
Nutritional deficiencies can lead to a number of health problems in children. Proper nutrition begins with the food you buy and continues at home in the way they are prepared and served. A child that gets a healthy start with good eating habits and nutritious foods can look forward to lifelong health. Young children need a variety of foods to build strong bodies and stay healthy. Food also supplies the energy that children need to grow and develop normally. 
Eating right is also very important for children with acute and chronic illnesses."
Obesity,"What is obesity?
Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means weighing too much. Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what is considered healthy for his or her height. Children grow at different rates, so it isn't always easy to know when a child is obese or overweight. Ask your doctor to measure your child's height and weight to determine if he or she is in a healthy range.
If a weight-loss program is necessary, involve the whole family in healthy habits so your child doesn't feel singled out. You can encourage healthy eating by:
Serving more fruits and vegetables
Buying fewer sodas and high-calorie, high-fat snack foods
Physical activity can also help your child overcome being overweight or obese. Kids need about 60 minutes of physical activity each day."
Omphalocele,"What is omphalocele?
An omphalocele is a birth defect in which the infant's intestine or other abdominal organs stick out of the belly button, or navel. In babies with an omphalocele, the intestines are covered only by a thin layer of tissue and can be easily seen. Approximately 25 percent to 40 percent of infants with an omphalocele have other birth defects, which may include genetic problems, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and heart defects.
Symptoms
An omphalocele can be clearly seen because the abdominal contents stick out through the belly button area. There are different sizes of omphaloceles. In small ones, only the intestines stick out. In larger ones, the liver or spleen may stick out of the body as well.
Diagnosis
Prenatal ultrasounds often identify infants with an omphalocele before birth. Otherwise, physical examination of the infant is sufficient to diagnose this condition. Testing is usually not necessary.
Treatment
Omphaloceles are repaired with surgery, although not always immediately. A sac protects the abdominal contents and allows time for other more serious problems (such as heart defects) to be dealt with first, if necessary.
To fix an omphalocele, the sac is covered with a special synthetic material, which is then stitched in place. Slowly, over time, the abdominal contents are pushed into the abdomen. When the omphalocele can comfortably fit within the abdominal cavity, the synthetic material is removed and the abdomen is closed.
Sometimes the omphalocele is so large that it cannot be place back inside the infants abdomen. The skin around the omphalocele grows and eventually covers the omphalocele. The abdominal muscles and skin can be repaired when the child is older in order to achieve a better cosmetic outcome.
Prognosis
Complete recovery is expected after surgery for an omphalocele. However, omphaloceles are frequently associated with other birth defects. How well a child does depends on any other conditions."
Otitis media,"Middle Ear Infection
Otitis media is inflammation or infection located in the middle ear. Otitis media can occur as a result of a cold, sore throat, or respiratory infection.
Facts about otitis media
About 3 out of 4 children have at least one episode of otitis media by the time they are 3 years of age.
Otitis media can also affect adults, although it is primarily a condition that occurs in children.
Who is at risk for getting ear infections?
While any child may develop an ear infection, the following are some of the factors that may increase your child's risk of developing ear infections:
Being around someone who smokes
Family history of ear infections
A weak immune system
Spends time in a daycare setting
Absence of breastfeeding
Having a cold
Bottle-fed while lying on his or her back
What causes ear infections?
Middle ear infections are usually a result of a malfunction of the eustachian tube, a canal that links the middle ear with the throat area. The eustachian tube helps to equalize the pressure between the outer ear and the middle ear. When this tube is not working properly, it prevents normal drainage of fluid from the middle ear, causing a build up of fluid behind the eardrum. When this fluid cannot drain, it allows for the growth of bacteria and viruses in the ear that can lead to acute otitis media. The following are some of the reasons that the eustachian tube may not work properly:
A cold or allergy which can lead to swelling and congestion of the lining of the nose, throat, and eustachian tube (this swelling prevents the normal drainage of fluids from the ear)
A malformation of the eustachian tube
What are the different types of otitis media?
Different types of otitis media include the following:
Acute otitis media. This middle ear infection occurs abruptly causing swelling and redness. Fluid and mucus become trapped inside the ear, causing the child to have a fever and ear pain.
Otitis media with effusion. Fluid (effusion) and mucus continue to accumulate in the middle ear after an initial infection subsides. The child may experience a feeling of fullness in the ear and it may affect his or her hearing or may have no symptoms.
Chronic otitis media with effusion. Fluid remains in the middle ear for a prolonged period or returns again and again, even though there is no infection. May result in difficulty fighting new infection and may affect the child's hearing.
Ear Infection Symptoms
The following are the most common symptoms of otitis media. However, each child may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Unusual irritability
Difficulty sleeping or staying asleep
Tugging or pulling at one or both ears
Fever, especially in infants and younger children 
Fluid draining from ear(s)
Loss of balance
Hearing difficulties
Ear pain
The symptoms of otitis media may resemble other conditions or medical problems. Always consult your child's health care provider for a diagnosis.
How is otitis media diagnosed?
In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination, your child's health care provider will inspect the outer ear(s) and eardrum(s) using an otoscope. The otoscope is a lighted instrument that allows the health care provider to see inside the ear. A pneumatic otoscope blows a puff of air into the ear to test eardrum movement.
Tympanometry is a test that can be performed in most health care providers' offices to help determine how the middle ear is functioning. It does not tell if the child is hearing or not, but helps to detect any changes in pressure in the middle ear. This is a difficult test to perform in younger children because the child needs to remain still and not cry, talk, or move.
A hearing test may be performed for children who have frequent ear infections.
Ear Infection Treatment
Specific treatment for otitis media will be determined by your child's health care provider based on the following:
Your child's age, overall health, and medical history
Extent of the condition
Your child's tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the condition
Your opinion or preference
Treatment may include:
Antibiotic medication by mouth or ear drops
Medication (for pain and fever)
Observation
A combination of the above
If fluid remains in the ear(s) for longer than three months, and the infection continues to reoccur even with the use of antibiotics, your child's health care provider may suggest that small tubes be placed in the ear(s). This surgical procedure, called myringotomy, involves making a small opening in the eardrum to drain the fluid and relieve the pressure from the middle ear. A small tube is placed in the opening of the eardrum to ventilate the middle ear and to prevent fluid from accumulating. The child's hearing is restored after the fluid is drained. The tubes usually fall out on their own after six to 12 months.
Your child's surgeon may also recommend the removal of the adenoids (lymph tissue located in the space above the soft roof of the mouth, also called the nasopharynx) if they are infected. Removal of the adenoids has shown to help some children with otitis media.
Treatment will depend on the type of otitis media. Consult your child's health care provider regarding treatment options.
Long Term Effects of Ear Infections
In addition to the symptoms of an ear infection listed above, untreated ear infections can result in any or all of the following:
Infection in other parts of the head
Permanent hearing loss
Problems with speech and language development"
Osteogenesis imperfecta,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited (genetic) bone disorder that is present at birth.
It is also known as brittle bone disease.
A child born with OI may have soft bones that break (fracture) easily, bones that are not formed normally, and other problems. Signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe.
The main goal of treatment is to prevent deformities and fractures.
OI is a lifelong condition."
Osteochondroma,"What is osteochondroma?
Osteochondroma is an overgrowth of cartilage and bone that happens at the end of the bone near the growth plate. Most often, it affects the long bones in the leg, the pelvis, or the shoulder blade.
Osteochondroma is the most common noncancerous bone growth. It most often occurs between ages 10 and 30. It affects males and females equally.
What causes osteochondroma?
While the exact cause of osteochondroma is not known. There is one type that is inherited and one type that is not inherited.
What are the symptoms of osteochondroma?
These are the most common symptoms of osteochondroma:
A hard, mass that is painless and does not move
Lower-than-normal-height for age
One leg or arm that is longer than the other
Pressure or irritation with exercise
Soreness of the nearby muscles
Often, people with osteochondroma will have no symptoms at all.
When they do happen, symptoms of osteochondroma may look like other medical problems. Always talk with your doctor for a diagnosis.
How is osteochondroma diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider will review your medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests include:
X-ray. This test uses invisible electromagnetic energy beams to make images of tissues, bones, and organs.
CT scan. This test uses X-rays and computer technology to make images (often called slices) of the body. A CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays.
MRI. This test uses large magnets, radiofrequencies, and a computer to make detailed images of organs and structures in the body.
How is osteochondroma treated?
Your healthcare provider will figure out the best treatment based on:
How old you are
Your overall health and medical history
How sick you are
How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Treatment for osteochondromas varies depending on the size of the growth and your symptoms. Treatment may include:
Surgery to remove the mass
Medicines to control pain
If there is no sign of bone weakening or increased overgrowth, your healthcare provider may want to watch it over time. Careful follow-up with a healthcare provider to monitor bone growth may be advised.

Pancreatitis,"What is pancreatitis?
Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, a large gland behind the stomach. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes into the small intestine to help digest fats, proteins and carbohydrates in food. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream. These hormones help the body use the glucose it takes from food for energy. Normally, digestive enzymes do not become active until they reach the small intestine, where they begin digesting food. But if these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they start to ""digest"" the pancreas itself.
Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. Chronic pancreatitis does not resolve itself and results in a slow destruction of the pancreas. Either form can cause serious complications. In severe cases, bleeding, tissue damage and infection may occur. Pseudocysts, accumulations of fluid and tissue debris, may also develop. And enzymes and toxins may enter the bloodstream, injuring the heart, lungs and kidneys or other organs.
Chronic pancreatitis is rare in children. Trauma to the pancreas and hereditary pancreatitis are two known causes of childhood pancreatitis. Children with cystic fibrosis — a progressive, disabling, and incurable lung disease — may also have pancreatitis. But more often the cause is not known.
Symptoms
Acute pancreatitis usually begins with pain in the upper abdomen that may last for a few days. The pain may be severe and may become constant — it may be just in the abdomen, or it may reach to the back and other areas. It may be sudden and intense or begin as a mild pain that gets worse when food is eaten. Someone with acute pancreatitis often looks and feels very sick. Other symptoms may include:
Swollen and tender abdomen
Nausea
Vomiting
Fever
Rapid pulse
Severe cases may cause dehydration and low blood pressure. The heart, lungs or kidneys may fail. If bleeding occurs in the pancreas, shock and sometimes even death follow.
Diagnosis
A doctor will order a blood test to diagnose acute pancreatitis. A doctor may also order an abdominal ultrasound to look for gallstones and a CAT (computerized axial tomography) scan to look for inflammation or destruction of the pancreas. CAT scans are also useful in locating pseudocysts.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the severity of the attack. If no kidney or lung complications occur, acute pancreatitis usually improves on its own. Treatment, in general, is designed to support vital bodily functions and prevent complications. A hospital stay will be necessary so that fluids can be replaced intravenously. If pancreatic pseudocysts occur and are considered large enough to interfere with the pancreas's healing, your doctor may drain or surgically remove them.
Unless the pancreatic duct or bile duct is blocked by gallstones, an acute attack usually lasts only a few days. In severe cases, a person may require intravenous feeding for three to six weeks while the pancreas slowly heals. This process is called total parenteral nutrition. However, for mild cases of the disease, total parenteral nutrition offers no benefit. After all signs of acute pancreatitis are gone, the doctor will try to decide what caused it in order to prevent future attacks. In some people, the cause of the attack is clear, but in others more tests are needed."
Parasomnia disorders,"Parasomnia disorders involve some type of abnormal behavior during sleep, such as walking or talking. Parasomnias may be categorized as primary parasomnias (disorders of sleep states) or secondary parasomnias (disorders of other organ systems that may manifest during sleep, including seizures, respiratory dyskinesia and gastroesophageal reflux).
Symptoms
Sudden partial awakening associated with confusion and disorientation
Sleepwalking, or arousal with complex motor behaviors like walking, running, talking or eating
Nightmares and night terrors
Paralysis occurring near the onset or end of sleep or during awakenings
Repetitive grinding of the teeth during sleep
These are the 4 most common parasomnias:
Nightmares and nightmare disorder
Night terrors
Bedwetting
Sleepwalking
Nightmares and nightmare disorder
Nightmares are frightening dreams that jolt the sleeper awake suddenly. People usually remember vivid details about their nightmares. If you have the same nightmare over and over, you're experiencing a nightmare disorder.
In adults, nightmares are frequently connected with conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and schizophrenia. They can happen more often during stressful life situations, such as the death of a loved one, a breakup or divorce, or loss of a job. They can also be related to certain medicines, such as antidepressants, narcotics, or seizure medicines.
Night terrors
Night terrors, also known as sleep terrors, are episodes of fear, confusion, and screaming during sleep. Toddlers experiencing night terrors may try crawling or walking in their sleep; if this happens, they have to be watched so that they don't hurt themselves. Night terrors usually last a few seconds to a few minutes and often occur with sleepwalking. Unlike with nightmares, a person experiencing a night terror will not wake up and will not remember anything the next morning.
Nightmares and night terrors are more common in children than adults. In children, they are rarely caused by a physical or mental illness. Both nightmares and night terrors are more common in people with other sleep problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea.
If your child is having nightmares, he or she will usually wake up suddenly and may come to you for comfort. You can explain to your child that he or she has had a bad dream.
Children experiencing a night terror might have their eyes open and seem to be awake, yet be confused, glassy-eyed, and unable to communicate. The child is often inconsolable. Your child might also:
Sit up in bed
Scream or shout
Kick or thrash around frantically
Breathe heavily and sweat
Be hard to wake up or hard to calm down
Stare wide-eyed
Get out of bed and crawl or run around the house
If your child is having a night terror, talk to your child calmly and gently and try to get him or her back into bed without shouting or shaking the child.
Diagnosis
Nightmares and night terrors are usually diagnosed by history alone. Some adults might need to undergo more evaluation, such as nerve testing, to make sure they do not have an underlying problem related to the night terrors.
Treatment
Nightmares and night terrors can be frightening, but they are usually nothing to worry about.  Most children will outgrow them by the time they are teenagers.  But it's important to make sure your child or family member is safe from harm during the night. 
If your child has night terrors, you may need to place gates on staircases to prevent injury and remove dangerous objects from your home. Children who have frequent night terrors should not sleep in bunk beds. Be sure to talk with your doctor if you or a family member ever gets hurt while sleeping.
Adults who have frequent nightmares and night terrors may benefit from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can be done with a counselor or at a sleep medicine center and can be effective after only a few sessions. 
Bedwetting
Doctors refer to nighttime bedwetting as nocturnal enuresis. This condition is fairly common in children. It's not unusual for children younger than 6 to wet the bed. It tends to affect boys more than girls. Enuresis is also much more common in children whose parents both had enuresis as children. 
Bedwetting often occurs when a child makes too much urine for the amount that his or her bladder can store. Children with the condition don't wake up when their bladder is full.
Diagnosis
You should take your child to the doctor if he is still wetting the bed after age 6. The doctor will probably ask you about your child's bathroom habits during the day and night and do a physical exam. The doctor will also do a urine test called a urinalysis to see if there is an obvious cause for the bedwetting, like a urinary tract infection or diabetes.
The doctor might ask you about how things are going at school and at home for your child. Although your child's bedwetting might be concerning to you, children who wet the bed are usually not more emotionally upset than other children.
If the doctor finds no underlying cause, the bedwetting is called primary nocturnal enuresis. If a separate medical condition, such as a urinary tract infection, diabetes, spinal cord abnormalities, or malformations of body parts like the urethra, is causing the bedwetting, it's called secondary nocturnal enuresis.
Treatment
Most children do not need treatment for bedwetting. If your doctor decides to treat your child, it will probably be with behavioral therapy or medication. These are possible behavioral therapy treatments:
Limit fluids before bedtime.
Have your child go to the bathroom at the beginning of the bedtime routine and again right before getting into bed.
Reward your child for dry nights.
Have your child help you change the sheets when he or she wets the bed.
Give your child bladder training, which involves having your child practice holding his or her urine for a while throughout the day so that the bladder stretches to accommodate more urine.
If behavioral therapy doesn't work for your child, and he or she is at least 7 years old, your doctor might prescribe medicine. One type of medicine helps the bladder hold more urine, and the other causes the kidneys to make less urine. These medicines can have side effects like flushing of the cheeks and dry mouth, and they are not a cure for bedwetting. 
Helping your child cope
It is important to remember that bedwetting is not a child's fault. It is not a mental or behavioral problem, and it does not happen because a child is too lazy to get out of bed. You should not make your child feel guilty or ashamed, or punish him or her for wetting the bed. 
Encourage your child to use the bathroom during the night, and place nightlights in hallways and rooms to make this easier. It may be helpful to use a waterproof mattress pad.
Sleepwalking
Sleepwalking, also know as somnambulism, is a disorder in which a person partially wakes up during the night and walks around without realizing it. The sleepwalker might make repetitive movements, such as fumbling with clothing, get out of bed and stroll around, or even talk to you. Sleepwalking is usually not a cause for concern. Most children will outgrow sleepwalking by their teenage years. 
If your child is sleepwalking, try to guide him or her gently back to bed. Don't shake or yell at your child in an attempt to wake him or her up. Another important consideration is your child's safety. As with night terrors, remove dangerous objects from the home and place gates on stairs to prevent falls. Keep doors and windows locked. 
Most children will not need treatment for sleepwalking. If your child sleepwalks for a long time or is having problems during the day due to lack of sleep, talk with your doctor. You might want to keep a sleep diary for a few weeks and record when your child sleepwalks. One method sometimes used to treat sleepwalking is waking your child up 15 minutes before he or she normally sleepwalks, but talk with your doctor before doing so. "
Pediatric hypertension,"What is hypertension?
Hypertension is the sustained elevation in blood pressure, meaning it is diagnosed when one's blood pressure is higher than normal on repeated measurements over time. In childhood and adolescence, blood pressure normally increases with age and height. So, a normal blood pressure value for your child will change each year, just as the normal values for their height and weight will change.
A child or adolescent is diagnosed with hypertension when their average blood pressure is at or above the 95th percentile for their age, sex and height when measured multiple times over three visits or more.
Do children really get hypertension?
Yes, and pediatric hypertension is on the rise. Over the last 30 to 40 years, pediatric hypertension in the United States has increased fourfold. Currently up to 4.5 percent — or 3.34 million — of children in the United States have this condition. Recent American Heart Association heart disease and stroke statistics suggest the number affected may be higher, estimating that 15 percent of adolescents have abnormal blood pressure.
While the reason for the increase in pediatric hypertension is not entirely clear, many consider it to be due to the coincident obesity epidemic. Since 1980, the prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents has almost tripled. Thirty-two percent of children in the United States are now overweight or obese. Further, when only considering this group of at risk children, the estimated proportion of children afflicted with hypertension is much greater, ranging from 20 percent to 47 percent.
How do I know if my child is hypertensive?
Your child should have his or her blood pressure measured at least once yearly, ideally at each health care encounter. If your child’s blood pressure is at or above the 90th percentile, testing should be repeated three times, ideally by manual auscultation (using a stethoscope and a blood pressure cuff inflated by hand). If the average of these three measurements is at or above the 95th percentile, your child should return to his or her health care provider for repeat measurements to confirm that their blood pressure is high. If the average blood pressure is less than the 95th percentile but greater than or equal to the 90th percentile (or greater than or equal to 120/80), then your child is prehypertensive and is at risk for developing hypertension. He or she should return in six months for repeat blood pressure measurements to screen for the development of hypertension.
Any child with an average blood pressure at or above the 95th percentile from multiple readings taken over several visits has hypertension.
Does being overweight impact my child’s blood pressure?
Yes. Children who are overweight or obese are more likely to be hypertensive. In addition, being overweight is sometimes the sole cause of a child or adolescent being hypertensive. Individuals who are overweight are also more likely to have other risk factors for heart disease like high cholesterol, diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy (abnormal thickening of the heart). It is for this reason that ALL children with hypertension should develop heart healthy behaviors.
Why do children with hypertension have to see a nephrologist?
Hypertension in children is often a symptom of another condition or illness. Because of this, all children with hypertension should undergo an evaluation to search for an underlying cause. Kidney disease is a main cause of high blood pressure and hypertension in children, which is why nephrologists are the providers who evaluate and treat this condition in children.
Children who are diagnosed with hypertension should undergo blood and urine testing and kidney and bladder imaging, as well as imaging of the heart.
How do you treat hypertension in children?
Treatment of hypertension in children should focus on the underlying cause and on the institution of a heart healthy lifestyle. Children and their families should adopt a lifestyle that includes the following:
Weight loss if overweight
Daily aerobic exercise:
Aim for 60 minutes or more of moderate to vigorous activity every day — choose an activity that gets your heart pumping like running, soccer, tennis or jumping jacks.
Minimal sedentary activities:
Limit activities such as computer/video/tablet games and TV watching to less than two hours per day.
Regular daily intake of fresh vegetables, fruits and low-fat dairy
Minimal to no sugar-sweetened drinks:
Eliminate empty calorie drinks like juice, soda and sweet tea.
Increase water intake.
Avoidance of foods high in salt:
Aim for no more than 1,500 mg sodium per day.
Take the salt shaker off the table!
Choose low cholesterol food options:
Limit cholesterol intake to less than 300 mg each day.
Stop smoking.
Some children will require medication to treat their blood pressure as well. Children who require blood pressure medication are those with a secondary cause identified, those who are symptomatic from their hypertension, those who also have a diagnosis of diabetes or evidence of organ damage from the hypertension (i.e., left ventricular hypertrophy — abnormal heart thickening) and those who continue to have hypertension after six months of implementing lifestyle changes.
What can I do to prevent my child from developing hypertension?
Because hypertension in children is often secondary to an underlying disease or condition, hypertension can often only be prevented in as much as the underlying condition can be prevented. In many other cases, hypertension can be prevented by adhering to a heart healthy lifestyle that includes a low-fat, low-sodium diet rich in fruits and vegetables, with regular physical activity, avoidance of smoking and maintenance of a healthy body weight."
Pelvic inflammatory disease,"What is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)?

Pelvic inflammatory disease or PID is an infection of a woman’s reproductive tract. It can affect the uterus, fallopian tubes, and the ovaries. Scar tissue grows between internal organs leading to ongoing pelvic pain. It can also lead to ectopic pregnancy. This is when the fertilized egg grows outside the uterus. If left untreated, PID can lead to chronic infection. Also, you may not be able to get pregnant.
What causes PID?

Bacteria cause PID. Often the same type of bacteria that causes sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). PID may also develop if bacteria travel through the vagina and the cervix from the use of an intrauterine device (IUD).
What are the risk factors for PID?

Women of any age can get PID. But, those at greater risk of PID from sexually transmitted bacteria include:
Women under 25 who are sexually active
Women of childbearing age
Women who use intrauterine devices (IUDs)
What are the symptoms of PID?

These are the most common symptoms of PID.
Pain and tenderness spread throughout the lower abdomen
Pelvic pain
Increased foul-smelling vaginal discharge
Fever and chills
Vomiting and nausea
Pain during urination
Abdominal pain (upper right area)
Pain during sex
The symptoms of PID may look like other conditions or health problems. Always consult your health care provider for a diagnosis.
How is PID diagnosed?

Your doctor will do a medical history and a physical and pelvic exam. Other tests may include:
Exam of vagina and cervix samples under a microscope
Blood tests
Pap test. For this test, cells are taken from the cervix and checked under a microscope. It's used to find cancer, infection, or inflammation.
Ultrasound. This test uses high-frequency sound waves to make an image of the organs.
Laparoscopy. This is a minor procedure done using a laparoscope. That is a thin tube with a lens and a light. It is inserted into an incision in the abdominal wall to view the reproductive tract.
Culdocentesis. For this test, a needle is inserted into the pelvic cavity through the vaginal wall to get a sample of pus.
How is PID treated?

Your health care provider will figure out the best treatment based on:
How old you are
Your overall health and medical history
How sick you are
How well you can handle specific medications, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Antibiotic pills are used to treat PID, especially if it’s due to a STD. For severe infection, you may need to stay in the hospital for intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Sometimes, surgery is needed.
Key points

Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is an infection of a woman’s reproductive tract. It can affect the uterus, fallopian tubes, and/or the ovaries.
Left untreated, chronic infection and infertility can develop.
It is caused by bacteria, often the same type of bacteria that causes STDs.
Sexually active women under age 25, and those of childbearing age are at the greatest risk of getting PID from an STD.
PID can cause pelvic pain, abdominal tenderness, vaginal discharge, fever, chills, and pain during urination and sex.
Treatment includes antibiotics, especially if you have a STD.
Next steps

Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you.
If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions."
Peptic ulcer,"A peptic ulcer is an open sore found on the lining of the stomach or duodenum (the first part of the small intestine).
A gastric ulcer is located in the lining of the stomach.

A: X-ray of gastric ulcer in the antrum; B: Corresponding illustration of a gastric ulcer
A duodenal ulcer is located in lining of the duodenum.

A: Duodenal ulcer; B: Corresponding x-ray
Peptic Ulcer Disease Symptoms
Symptoms of peptic ulcer disease may be similar to other upper gastrointestinal conditions. Symptoms include:
Abdominal discomfort or pain
Nausea
Pain radiating to the back (which could indicate the ulcer has penetrated)
Burning or gnawing feeling similar to hunger pains
Pain aggravated by meals (may suggest gastric ulcers)
Pain relieved by meals (may suggest duodenal ulcers)
Because the symptoms of peptic ulcer disease are often nonspecific, it is important that you see a gastroenterologist for diagnosis.
Peptic ulcers; A: Malignant; B: Benign
Peptic Ulcer Disease Diagnosis
Diagnosis of peptic ulcer disease begins with a comprehensive physical exam. You will be asked about your symptoms and medical history.
Other diagnostic tests your doctor may order include:
Barium contrast radiography
Laboratory testing
Gastrointestinal endoscopy
Barium Contrast Radiography
Barium contrast radiography (X-ray) or upper gastrointestinal (GI) series are specialized X-rays so your doctor can check for abnormalities.
During barium contrast radiography:
You swallow a contrast solution called barium.
The barium coats your esophagus and gastrointestinal tract, making it easier for the doctor to detect peptic ulcers.
An X-ray is taken.
Barium X-ray does not offer a definitive diagnosis, as it does not distinguish between benign and malignant ulcers. In addition, the X-ray may be difficult to interpret in patients who had previous gastric surgery or scarring from chronic inflammation.
Laboratory Testing
Patients who do not respond to standard therapy for peptic ulcers may need specialized testing. If your symptoms do not improve after eight weeks of therapy, your doctor may want to order special tests. These include:
Measuring serum gastrin and serum calcium: High levels of these hormones may indicate a more serious problem, such as:
Gastrinomas: Tumors associated with a rare gastroenterological disorder called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN): A disorder in which endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor
Testing for H. pylori infection. Your doctor may test for this in a number of ways:
Endoscopy with biopsy to obtain a tissue sample to test for the bacteria
Urea breath tests, a noninvasive method
Serologic testing, a blood test
Stool antigen, another noninvasive method of testing for H. pylori
Endoscopic Diagnosis
Your doctor may perform a gastrointestinal endoscopy with biopsy to diagnose peptic ulcer disease. A gastrointestinal endoscopy allows your doctor to examine the mucous lining of your upper gastrointestinal tract.
The endoscopy and biopsy are two parts of the same procedure:
Endoscopy refers to the use of a flexible, lighted tube called an endoscope. Your doctor inserts the endoscope into your stomach through your mouth. The endoscope has a camera at the end so your doctor can see the inside of your body.
Biopsy means your doctor removes a small tissue sample to send to a pathology lab for analysis.
During an upper endoscopy:
You receive anesthesia and will be asleep during the procedure.
You lie on your left side, referred to as the left lateral position.
Your doctor inserts the endoscope through your mouth and pharynx into the esophagus.
The endoscope transmits an image of the esophagus, stomach and duodenum to a monitor that your physician is watching.
Biopsy forceps will be inserted into the endoscope to remove a tissue sample.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a specific endoscopy exam to diagnose peptic ulcer disease. This test can identify the ulcer, its location and size."
Perinatal asphyxia,"What is perinatal asphyxia?
Perinatal asphyxia, or birth asphyxia, results from an inadequate intake of oxygen by the baby during the birth process — before, during or just after birth. Decreased oxygen intake can result in chemical changes in the baby's body that include hypoxemia, or low levels of oxygen in the blood, and acidosis, in which too much acid builds up in the blood.
Symptoms
Symptoms of birth asphyxia may not be obvious, but the most common symptoms include:
Before birth, abnormal fetal heart rate and low pH levels, indicating too much acid
At birth, poor skin color, low heart rate, weak muscle tone, gasping or weak breathing and meconium stained amniotic fluid
Diagnosis
Severe acid levels
Apgar score of 0 to 3 for longer than five minutes
Evidence of neurologic problems, including coma and seizure
Problems with one or more organ systems, including circulatory, digestive and respiratory
Treatment
Treatment may include:
Giving the mother extra amounts of oxygen before delivery
Emergency delivery or cesarean section
Mechanical breathing machine
Medication"
Persistent pulmonary hypertension,"What is persistent pulmonary hypertension?
In persistent pulmonary hypertension, also known as persistent fetal circulation, a newborn’s circulation reverts back to the circulation of a fetus, where much of the blood flow bypasses the lungs. It occurs most often in full-term babies after a difficult birth, or birth asphyxia.
Symptoms
Baby appears ill at delivery or in first hours after birth
Cyanosis, or blue coloring
Rapid breathing and rapid heart rate
Low blood oxygen levels
Diagnosis
Physical examination of the infant is sufficient for the health care provider to diagnose gastroschisis. The mother may have shown signs indicating excessive amniotic fluid, a condition called polyhydramnios. Prenatal ultrasonography often identifies gastroschisis.
Treatment
Treatments may include:
Supplemental oxygen
Placing an endotracheal tube into the baby's windpipe
Mechanical breathing machine
Medications to relax the baby's muscles so that he will better respond to the mechanical ventilator
Inhalation of nitric oxide to help dilate the blood vessels in the lungs
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)"
Pertussis,"What is pertussis?
Pertussis is a serious bacterial infection of the lining of the breathing passages, particularly in the windpipe area. Pertussis, also called whooping cough, is caused by Bordetella pertussis bacteria and is extremely contagious. Anyone can get whooping cough, but it is more common in infants and children. It's especially dangerous in infants. The coughing spells can be so bad that it is hard for infants to eat, drink or breathe."
Pharyngitis,"What is pharyngitis?
Pharyngitis — commonly known as sore throat — is an inflammation of the pharynx, resulting in a sore throat. Thus, pharyngitis is a symptom, rather than a condition. It is usually caused by viral and/or bacterial infections, such as the common cold and flu (both viral infections) or by infection with the Streptococcus bacterium (strep throat). Pharyngitis can also occur with mononucleosis (aka “mono”), a viral infection.
Fungal pharyngitis occurs in the setting of immunosuppression or chronic steroid and antibiotic use. Sometimes, allergies, such as hay fever or allergic rhinitis, can cause sore throat. Dry indoor air and chronic mouth breathing, especially in the winter, can lead to recurrent sore throat, particularly in the morning, after waking up. Muscle strain associated with voice use can cause a pain in the throat that is similar to pharyngitis. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can lead to chronic sore throat because of stomach acid reflux irritating the throat.
What are symptoms of pharyngitis?
Sore throat
Dry, scratchy throat
Pain when swallowing
Pain when speaking
Other symptoms may be present, depending on the cause. These include fatigue, malaise, muscle aches, headache and fever — especially with the flu or other viral infections.
How is pharyngitis diagnosed?
Diagnosis requires a physical exam and laryngoscopy (scope exam in a clinic) to assess for all the possible causes of pharyngitis.
How is pharyngitis treated?
The treatment depends on the cause. Viral pharyngitis goes away on its own with salt water gargles, pain relievers and extra fluids to help alleviate the symptoms. Bacterial pharyngitis is treated with antibiotics; and fungal pharyngitis, with antifungal medications. Prompt antibiotic therapy is needed for strep throat because untreated, it can sometimes cause kidney problems and rheumatic fever, which can damage the heart valves. A full assessment in the clinic will guide treatment for other causes.
When to Call Your Doctor for Pharyngitis
Call your doctor if you notice any of the symptoms listed above. You should be seen by a doctor if your symptoms doesn’t go away in a week; if you notice swollen lymph nodes on your neck; or if you discover pus or white patches on the back of the throat, blood in the spit or phlegm; or a rash."
Pleurisy,"What is pleurisy?
Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, a large, thin sheet of tissue that wraps around the outside of your lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. Between the layer of the pleura that wraps around your lungs and the layer that lines your chest cavity is a very thin space called the pleural space. Normally this space is filled with a small amount of fluid that helps the two layers of the pleura glide smoothly past each other as your lungs breathe air in and out. Pleurisy occurs when the two layers of the pleura become red and inflamed, rubbing against each other every time your lungs expand to breathe in air. Infections like pneumonia are the most common cause of pleurisy.
Symptoms
The main symptom of pleurisy is a sharp or stabbing pain in your chest that gets worse when you breathe in deeply or cough or sneeze. The pain may stay in one place or it may spread to your shoulder or back. Sometimes it becomes a fairly constant dull ache. Depending on what's causing the pleurisy, you may have other symptoms, such as:
Shortness of breath
A cough
Fever and chills
Rapid, shallow breathing
Unexplained weight loss
A sore throat followed by pain and swelling in your joints
Diagnosis
Your doctor will find out if you have pleurisy or another pleural disorder by taking a detailed medical history and doing a physical exam and several diagnostic tests, including:
Chest X-ray to show air or fluid in the pleural space, and what's causing the condition (for example, pneumonia, a fractured rib, or a lung tumor)
CT scan that can show pockets of fluid, signs of pneumonia, a lung abscess or a tumor
Ultrasound, which can show where fluid is located in your chest
Magnetic resonance (MR) scan, which can show pleural effusions and tumors
Blood tests, which can show whether you have a bacterial or viral infection, pneumonia, rheumatic fever, a pulmonary embolism or lupus
Arterial blood gas tests, which show how well your lungs are taking in oxygen
Treatment
A procedure called thoracentesis is used to remove fluid from the pleural space. The doctor inserts a needle or a thin, hollow, plastic tube through the ribs in the back of your chest into your chest wall. A syringe is attached to draw fluid out of your chest.
To relieve symptoms, your doctor may recommend:
Acetaminophen or anti-inflammatory agents, such as ibuprofen, to control pain
Codeine-based cough syrups to control a cough
Lying on the painful side to make you more comfortable
Breathing deeply and coughing to clear mucus as the pain eases
Your doctor will look at the fluid under a microscope to determine what's causing the fluid buildup. If the fluid is infected, treatment involves antibiotics and draining the fluid. If the infection is tuberculosis or from a fungus, treatment involves long-term use of antibiotics or antifungal medicines. If the fluid is caused by tumors of the pleura, it may build up again quickly after it's drained. Sometimes antitumor medicines will prevent further fluid buildup. If they don't, the doctor may seal the pleural space."
Pneumomediastinum,"What is pneumomediastinum?
Pneumomediastinum, also known as mediastinal emphysema, is a condition in which air is present in the mediastinum (the space in the chest between the two lungs). This can be caused by a traumatic injury or in association with pneumothorax or other diseases.
Symptoms
Pneumomediastinum may not be accompanied by any symptoms. Usually, it causes severe chest pain below the sternum, or breastbone, that may radiate to the neck or arms. The pain may be worse with breathing or swallowing.
Diagnosis
During a physical examination, the doctor may feel small bubbles of air under the skin of the chest, arms or neck. A chest X-ray or CT scan of the chest may be done to confirm the presence of air in the mediastinum.
Treatment
Often, no treatment is required as the air is gradually absorbed from the mediastinum. If pneumomediastinum is accompanied by pneumothorax, a chest tube may be placed. Breathing high concentrations of oxygen may allow the air in the mediastinum to be absorbed more quickly.
Prognosis
The outlook depends on the disease or events that caused the pneumomediastinum."
Pneumonia,"What is pneumonia?
Pneumonia is an infection of one or both of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It is a serious infection in which the air sacs fill with pus and other liquid.
Lobar pneumonia affects one or more sections (lobes) of the lungs.
Bronchial pneumonia (also known as bronchopneumonia) affects patches throughout both lungs.
What causes pneumonia?
There are more than 30 different causes of pneumonia, and they’re grouped by the cause. The main types of pneumonia are:
Bacterial pneumonia. This type is caused by various bacteria. The most common is Streptococcus pneumoniae. It usually occurs when the body is weakened in some way, such as by illness, poor nutrition, old age, or impaired immunity, and the bacteria are able to work their way into the lungs. Bacterial pneumonia can affect all ages, but you are at greater risk if you abuse alcohol, smoke cigarettes, are debilitated, have recently had surgery, have a respiratory disease or viral infection, or have a weakened immune system.
Viral pneumonia. This type is caused by various viruses, including the flu (influenza), and is responsible for about one-third of all pneumonia cases. You may be more likely to get bacterial pneumonia if you have viral pneumonia.
Mycoplasma pneumonia. This type has somewhat different symptoms and physical signs and is referred to as atypical pneumonia. It is caused by the bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae. It generally causes a mild, widespread pneumonia that affects all age groups.
Other pneumonias. There are other less common pneumonias that may be caused by other infections including fungi.
Who is at risk for pneumonia?
Anyone can get pneumonia. However, the following groups are at the highest risk:
Adults ages 65 and older
Children younger than age 2
People with certain medical conditions
People that smoke
What are the symptoms of pneumonia?
The symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include:
Bluish color to lips and fingernails
Confused mental state or delirium, especially in older people
Cough that produces green, yellow, or bloody mucus
Fever
Heavy sweating
Loss of appetite
Low energy and extreme tiredness
Rapid breathing
Rapid pulse
Shaking chills
Sharp or stabbing chest pain that’s worse with deep breathing or coughing
Shortness of breath that gets worse with activity
Early symptoms of viral pneumonia are the same as those of bacterial pneumonia, which may be followed by:
Headache
Increasing shortness of breath
Muscle pain
Weakness
Worsening of the cough
Mycoplasma pneumonia has somewhat different symptoms, which include a severe cough that may produce mucus.
How is pneumonia diagnosed?
Diagnosis is usually made based on your recent health history (such as surgery, a cold, or travel exposures) and the extent of the illness. Based on these factors, your healthcare provider may diagnose pneumonia simply on a thorough history and physical exam. The following tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis:
Chest X-ray. This test takes pictures of internal tissues, bones, and organs, including the lungs.
Blood tests. This test may be used to see whether infection is present and if infection has spread to the bloodstream (blood cultures). Arterial blood gas testing checks the amount of oxygen in your bloodstream.
Sputum culture. This test is done on the material that is coughed up from the lungs and into the mouth. It’s often used to see if there’s an infection in the lungs.
Pulse oximetry. An oximeter is a small machine that measures the amount of oxygen in the blood. A small sensor is taped or clipped onto a finger. When the machine is on, a small red light can be seen in the sensor. The test is painless and the red light does not get hot.
Chest CT scan. This imaging procedure uses a combination of X-rays and computer technology to produce sharp, detailed horizontal, or axial, images (often called slices) of the body. A CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat, and organs. CT scans are more detailed than regular X-rays.
Bronchoscopy. This is direct exam of the bronchi (the main airways of the lungs) using a flexible tube (called a bronchoscope). It helps to evaluate and diagnose lung problems, assess blockages, and take out samples of tissue and/or fluid for testing,
Pleural fluid culture. In this test, a sample of a fluid sample is taken from the pleural space. This is the space between the lungs and chest wall. A long, thin needle is put through the skin between the ribs and into the pleural space. Fluid is pulled into a syringe attached to the needle. It is sent to the lab where it’s tested to find out which bacteria is causing the pneumonia.
How is pneumonia treated?
Treatment depends on the type of pneumonia you have. Most of the time, pneumonia is treated at home, but severe cases may be treated in the hospital. Antibiotics are used for bacterial pneumonia. Antibiotics may also speed recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia and some special cases. Most viral pneumonias don’t have specific treatment. They usually get better on their own.
Other treatment may include eating well, increasing fluid intake, getting rest, oxygen therapy, pain medicine, fever control, and maybe cough-relief medicine if cough is severe.
Can pneumonia be prevented?
Check with your healthcare provider about getting immunizations. The flu is a common cause of pneumonia. Because of that, getting a flu shot every year can help prevent both the flu and pneumonia.
There is also a pneumococcal vaccine. It will protect you from a common form of bacterial pneumonia. Children younger than age 5 and adults ages 65 and older should get this shot.
The pneumococcal shot is also recommended for all children and adults who are at increased risk of pneumococcal disease due to other health conditions.
What are the complications of pneumonia?
Most people with pneumonia respond well to treatment, but pneumonia can be very serious and even deadly.
You are more likely to have complications if you are an older adult, a very young child, have a weakened immune system, or have a serious medical problem like diabetes or cirrhosis. Complications may include:
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This is a severe form of respiratory failure.
Lung abscesses. These are pockets of pus that form inside or around the lung. They may need to be drained with surgery
Respiratory failure. This requires the use of a breathing machine or ventilator.
Sepsis. This is when the infection gets into the blood. It may lead to organ failure.
Key points about pneumonia
Pneumonia is an infection of one or both of the lungs caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
There are more than 30 different causes of pneumonia, and they’re grouped by the cause. The main types of pneumonia are bacterial, viral, and mycoplasma pneumonia.
A cough that produces green, yellow, or bloody mucus is the most common symptom of pneumonia. Other symptoms include fever, shaking chills, shortness of breath, low energy, and extreme tiredness.
Pneumonia can often be diagnosed with a thorough history and physical exam. Tests used to look at the lungs, blood tests, and tests done on the sputum you cough up may also be used.
Treatment depends on the type of pneumonia you have. Antibiotics are used for bacterial pneumonia. It may also speed recovery from mycoplasma pneumonia and some special cases. Most viral pneumonias don’t have a specific treatment and just get better on their own. Other treatment may include a healthy diet, more fluids, rest, oxygen therapy, and medicine for pain, cough, and fever control.
Most people with pneumonia respond well to treatment, but pneumonia can cause serious lung and infection problems. It can even be deadly."
Pneumothorax,"What is pneumothorax?
Pneumothorax is air around or outside the lung. It may result from chest trauma, excess pressure on the lungs or a lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis, tuberculosis or whooping cough. In some cases, the cause is unclear.
Symptoms
Sudden sharp chest pain made worse by a deep breath or a cough
Shortness of breath
Chest tightness
Easy fatigue
Rapid heart rate
Bluish color of the skin caused by lack of oxygen
Diagnosis
There are decreased or no breath sounds on the affected side when heard through a stethoscope. Tests include:
Chest X-ray to tell whether there is air outside the lung
Arterial blood gases
Treatment
Small pneumothoraces may go away on their own. For larger pneumothoraces, the air must be removed from around the lung. A chest tube placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs helps drain the air and allows the lung to re-expand. Some people need extra oxygen to help air around the lung be reabsorbed more quickly. Surgery may be needed to prevent future episodes.
Prognosis
Up to 50 percent of patients who have a pneumothorax will have another, but there are no long-term complications after successful treatment."
Polycystic kidney disease,"What is polycystic kidney disease?
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a genetic condition marked by the growth of numerous cysts (fluid-filled sacs) in the kidneys. The cysts become larger and the kidneys enlarge along with them. Slowly, the kidneys lose their ability to filter waste from the blood, which leads to progressive loss of kidney function and eventually to kidney failure. Some 600,000 people in the United States have PKD. PKD can also cause cysts in other organs, such as the liver."
Polycystic ovary syndrome,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which the ovaries produce an abnormal amount of androgens, male sex hormones that are usually present in women in small amounts. The name polycystic ovary syndrome describes the numerous small cysts (fluid-filled sacs) that form in the ovaries. However, some women with this disorder do not have cysts, while some women without the disorder do develop cysts.
Ovulation occurs when a mature egg is released from an ovary. This happens so it can be fertilized by a male sperm. If the egg is not fertilized, it is sent out of the body during your period.
In some cases, a woman doesn’t make enough of the hormones needed to ovulate. When ovulation doesn’t happen, the ovaries can develop many small cysts. These cysts make hormones called androgens. Women with PCOS often have high levels of androgens. This can cause more problems with a woman’s menstrual cycle. And it can cause many of the symptoms of PCOS.
Treatment for PCOS is often done with medication. This can’t cure PCOS, but it helps reduce symptoms and prevent some health problems.
What causes PCOS?
The exact cause of PCOS is not clear. Many women with PCOS have insulin resistance. This means the body can't use insulin well. Insulin levels build up in the body and may cause higher androgen levels. Obesity can also increase insulin levels and make PCOS symptoms worse.
PCOS may also run in families. It's common for sisters or a mother and daughter to have PCOS.
What are the risks for PCOS?
You may be more likely to have PCOS if your mother or sister has it. You may also be more likely to have it if you have insulin resistance or are obese.
What are the symptoms of PCOS?
The symptoms of PCOS may include:
Missed periods, irregular periods, or very light periods
Ovaries that are large or have many cysts
Excess body hair, including the chest, stomach, and back (hirsutism)
Weight gain, especially around the belly (abdomen)
Acne or oily skin
Male-pattern baldness or thinning hair
Infertility 
Small pieces of excess skin on the neck or armpits (skin tags)
Dark or thick skin patches on the back of the neck, in the armpits, and under the breasts
How is PCOS diagnosed?
Your health care provider will ask about your medical history and your symptoms. You will also have a physical exam. This will likely include a pelvic exam. This exam checks the health of your reproductive organs, both inside and outside your body.
Some of the symptoms of PCOS are like those caused by other health problems. Because of this, you may also have tests such as:
Ultrasound. This test uses sound waves and a computer to create images of blood vessels, tissues, and organs. This test is used to look at the size of the ovaries and see if they have cysts. The test can also look at the thickness of the lining of the uterus (endometrium).
Blood tests. These look for high levels of androgens and other hormones. Your health care provider may also check your blood glucose levels. And you may have your cholesterol and triglyceride levels checked.
How is PCOS treated?
Treatment for PCOS depends on a number of factors. These may include your age, how severe your symptoms are, and your overall health. The type of treatment may also depend on whether you want to become pregnant in the future.
If you do plan to become pregnant, your treatment may include:
A change in diet and activity. A healthy diet and more physical activity can help you lose weight and reduce your symptoms. They can also help your body use insulin more efficiently, lower blood glucose levels, and may help you ovulate.
Medications to cause ovulation. Medications can help the ovaries to release eggs normally. These medications also have certain risks. They can increase the chance for a multiple birth (twins or more). And they can cause ovarian hyperstimulation. This is when the ovaries release too many hormones. It can cause symptoms such as abdominal bloating and pelvic pain.
If you do not plan to become pregnant, your treatment may include:
Birth control pills. These help to control menstrual cycles, lower androgen levels, and reduce acne.
Diabetes medication. This is often used to lower insulin resistance in PCOS. It may also help reduce androgen levels, slow hair growth, and help you ovulate more regularly.
A change in diet and activity. A healthy diet and more physical activity can help you lose weight and reduce your symptoms. They can also help your body use insulin more efficiently, lower blood glucose levels, and may help you ovulate.
Medications to treat other symptoms. Some medications can help reduce hair growth or acne.
What are the complications of PCOS?
Women with PCOS are more likely to develop certain serious health problems. These include type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, problems with the heart and blood vessels, and uterine cancer. Women with PCOS often have problems with their ability to get pregnant (fertility).
Living with PCOS
Some women struggle with the physical symptoms of PCOS, such as weight gain, hair growth, and acne. Cosmetic treatments, such as electrolysis and laser hair removal, may help you feel better about your appearance. Talk with your health care provider about the best ways to treat the symptoms that bother you.
When should I seek medical care?
If you have missed or irregular periods, excess hair growth, acne, and weight gain, call your doctor for an evaluation.
Key points
PCOS is a very common hormone problem for women of childbearing age.
Women with PCOS may not ovulate, have high levels of androgens, and have many small cysts on the ovaries.
PCOS can cause missed or irregular menstrual periods, excess hair growth, acne, infertility, and weight gain. 
Women with PCOS may be at higher risk for type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems, and endometrial cancer.
The types of treatment for PCOS may depend on whether or not a woman plans to become pregnant. Women who plan to become pregnant in the future may take different kinds of medications.

Precocious puberty,"What is Precocious Puberty? 
Precocious puberty means sexual development that begins prematurely, before age 8 in girls and before age 9 in boys. It happens when the pituitary gland releases sex hormones called gonadotropins, which stimulate the development of the ovaries in girls and testes and boys, which in turn triggers the female sex hormone estrogen in girls and the male sex hormone testosterone in boys. In some cases, precocious puberty is a symptom of another disorder, such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia or tumors of the testes or ovaries or tumors of the adrenal gland that cause the release of sex hormones. Tumors in the pituitary gland or hypothalamus can also cause precocious puberty. 
A similar disorder is pseudo-precocious puberty in which estrogen and testosterone are secreted by tumors in the adrenal gland or in the testis or ovaries. However, unlike true precocious puberty, the ovaries or the testes themselves do not mature. 
Sometimes, no cause can be found for early puberty. 
Symptoms 
Development of adult features and characteristics 
Adult body odor 
Pubic hair and underarm hair 
Facial hair and voice changes in boys 
Acne 
Breast development and menstruation in girls 
Rapid height growth that abruptly stops at an early age 
Diagnosis 
Blood tests to determine levels of sex hormones 
X-rays of the hand to determine bone age 
Ultrasound of the pelvis and adrenal glands 
CT or MRI imaging of the head to rule out tumors in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland 
When to Call for Help
If your child starts to exhibit any of the above signs at an abnormally early age, call a health-care provider. 
Treatment 
Most cases of precocious or pseudo-precocious puberty are treated with synthetic hormones or certain medications that inhibit the release and effects of sex hormones. When the premature production of sex hormones is caused by a tumor, surgical removal of the tumor is the preferred treatment. "
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis,"What is progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis?
Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) is a disorder that causes progressive liver disease, which typically leads to liver failure. In people with PFIC, liver cells are less able to secrete bile, and the buildup of bile in liver cells causes liver disease. There are three known types of PFIC: PFIC1, PFIC2 and PFIC3. The types are also sometimes described as shortages of particular proteins needed for normal liver function. Each type has a different genetic cause.
Symptoms
PFIC symptoms typically begin in infancy and are related to bile buildup and liver disease. Specifically, affected individuals experience severe itching, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive), high blood pressure in the vein that supplies blood to the liver (portal hypertension) and an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly).
In addition to signs and symptoms related to liver disease, people with PFIC1 may have short stature, deafness, diarrhea, inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis) and low levels of fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E and K) in the blood. Affected individuals typically develop liver failure before adulthood.
The signs and symptoms of PFIC2 are typically related to liver disease only; however, these signs and symptoms tend to be more severe than those experienced by people with PFIC1. People with PFIC2 often develop liver failure within the first few years of life. Additionally, affected individuals are at increased risk of developing a type of liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma.
Most people with PFIC3 have signs and symptoms related to liver disease only. Signs and symptoms of PFIC3 usually do not appear until later in infancy or early childhood; rarely, people are diagnosed in early adulthood. Liver failure can occur in childhood or adulthood in people with PFIC3.
Diagnosis
Genetic testing
Blood tests
Liver biopsy
Treatment
PFIC treatment can include the following:
Drugs to treat cholestasis, which is reduced bile formation or flow
Surgery
Liver transplantation in severe cases"
Proteinuria,"What is proteinuria?
Proteinuria, also called albuminuria, is elevated protein in the urine. It is not a disease in and of itself but a symptom of certain conditions affecting the kidneys. Typically, too much protein in the urine means that the kidneys’ filters — the glomeruli — are not working properly and are allowing too much protein to escape in the urine. When the glomeruli are damaged the condition is called nephritis or glomerulonephritis. Other conditions can lead to nephritis, including hypertension, heart disease and diabetes, as well as other types of kidney disease.
Albumin is the protein most likely to appear in the urine, which is why proteinuria is sometimes called albuminuria. Other proteins can also leak into the urine. The level and type of protein reveals the degree of the damage, as well as the risk for developing kidney failure. If the protein levels are only minimally elevated, the condition is called microalbuminuria and signals minimal damage. However, as the condition progresses, the damage gets worse and more protein escapes into the urine, leading to full-blown albuminuria.
Symptoms
Foamy urine
Swelling of the hands, feet, face and/or abdomen
Remember: In the early stages, proteinuria may not cause visible symptoms.
Diagnosis
A fast dipstick urine test can detect protein in the urine. A paper stick dipped in the urine will change color if protein levels are high.
Further tests, however, are needed to determine the exact amount of protein and the ratios of certain proteins to other substances in the urine. More tests are needed to determine the exact cause of proteinuria. These include blood tests to measure creatinine and urea nitrogen, waste materials filtered by the kidneys that are elevated in people with impaired kidney function.
Some organizations and experts recommend routine protein screening for people at high risk for kidney damage. Groups at high risk for kidney failure include African Americans, American Indians, Hispanics/Latinos, Pacific Islander Americans, people with diabetes and/or hypertension and people with family histories of kidney disease.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the condition. If nephritis is the cause, determining the reason for the kidney inflammation and treating accordingly is the first step. If hypertension or diabetes is the cause, the first goal is to control high blood pressure or blood sugar, respectively.
When to Call for Help
If your child has foamy urine and/or puffiness around the eyes, swelling of the face, hands or feet, talk to your pediatrician."
Pulmonary hypertension,"What is primary pulmonary hypertension?
Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is high blood pressure in the lungs. It’s a rare lung disorder in which the blood vessels in the lungs narrow and the pressure in the pulmonary artery rises far above normal levels. The pulmonary arteries carry blood from your body to the lungs where carbon dioxide is traded for oxygen.
Pulmonary hypertension is a serious, chronic disease that can lead to heart failure if it’s not treated.
What causes primary pulmonary hypertension?
The cause of primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is unknown. Often, there is no underlying heart or lung disease causing the high blood pressure.
Some forms of pulmonary hypertension are linked to a gene defect that can run in families. Researchers believe this gene mutation makes the blood vessels more sensitive to certain factors and they constrict, or narrow, when exposed to these factors.
What are the symptoms of primary pulmonary hypertension?
The following are the most common symptoms for primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Symptoms can develop so slowly that you can have it for years without knowing it. However, each person may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Extreme tiredness (fatigue)
Trouble breathing or shortness of breath, especially with activity
Dry cough
Dizziness
Fainting
Swelling in the ankles or legs
Bluish lips and skin
Chest pain (angina)
Racing pulse
Trouble getting enough air
You feel like your heart is fluttering, or beating fast or hard (palpitations)
These symptoms get worse as the disease progresses. More severe symptoms are a sign of more advanced disease. In advanced stages, you may:
Have symptoms even when resting
May become bedridden
The symptoms of PPH look like other conditions or medical problems, and PPH can be hard to diagnose. Consult a health care provider for a diagnosis.
How is primary pulmonary hypertension diagnosed?
Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is rarely discovered in a routine medical exam. In its later stages, the signs of the disease can be confused with other conditions affecting the heart and lungs.
PPH may be diagnosed when other diseases are ruled out. Tests may include:
Chest X-ray. A test that takes pictures of internal tissues, including the heart.
Electrocardiogram (ECG). This test records the strength and timing of the electrical activity of the heart. It shows abnormal rhythms  and can sometimes detect heart muscle damage. Small sensors are taped to your skin to pick up the electrical activity.
Echocardiogram (echo). This test uses sound waves to check the heart's chambers and valves. The echo sound waves create a picture on a screen as an ultrasound transducer is passed over the skin over the heart. Echo can show damage and enlargement of the heart.
Pulmonary function tests (PFTs). These are diagnostic tests that help to measure the lungs' ability to move air into and out of the lungs. The tests are usually done with special machines you breathe into.
Perfusion lung scan. A type of nuclear radiology test in which a small amount of a radioactive substance is used to help find changes in the arteries leading to the lungs and blood flow within the lungs. This scan can also be used to assess the function of the lungs.
Cardiac catheterization of the right side of the heart. With this procedure, X-rays are taken after a dye (contrast agent) is injected into the pulmonary artery to look for any narrowing, blockages, or other changes. This is the only test that directly measures the pressure inside the pulmonary arteries.
Blood tests. These can be used to check the oxygen levels in the blood, evaluate liver and kidney function, and look for other diseases. Certain blood tests can also help to assess strain on the heart.
How is primary pulmonary hypertension treated?
There is no cure for primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). Treatment is aimed at managing symptoms and may include one or more of the following:
Medications
These include:
Anticoagulants. These are blood thinners used to make the blood less likely to clot and help it flow more freely.
Diuretics. These ""water pills"" are used to decrease the amount of fluid in the body, reduce swelling, and reduce the amount of work the heart has to do.
Calcium channel blocking/vasodilator drugs. These are used to improve the heart's ability to pump blood.
Other drugs. These are used to help lower blood pressure in the lungs and help the heart beat stronger and pump more blood.
Oxygen therapy
Some people also need supplemental oxygen delivered through nasal prongs or a mask if breathing becomes difficult.
Lung or heart-lung transplant
This may be an choice for people with severe PPH.

Pyloric stenosis,"What is pyloric stenosis?
Pyloric stenosis is a narrowing of the pylorus, the opening from the stomach, into the small intestine. This type of blockage is also referred to as a gastric outlet obstruction. Normally, food passes easily from the stomach into the duodenum through a valve called the pylorus. In pyloric stenosis, the muscles of the pylorus are abnormally thickened, which prevents the stomach from emptying into the small intestine, and food backs up into the esophagus. The cause of the thickening is unknown, although genetic factors may play a role. The condition is usually diagnosed by the time a child is six months old.
Symptoms
Vomiting is the first symptom in most children:
Vomiting may occur after every feeding or only after some feedings.
Vomiting usually starts around three weeks of age but may start any time between one week and five months of age.
Vomiting is forceful (projectile vomiting) and the vomit itself is usually clear or has the appearance of partially digested (curdled) milk.
The infant is hungry after vomiting and wants to feed again.
Other symptoms generally appear several weeks after birth and may include:
Abdominal pain
Belching
Constant hunger
Dehydration (gets worse with the severity of the vomiting)
Failure to gain weight or weight loss
Wave-like motion of the abdomen shortly after feeding and just before vomiting occurs
Diagnosis
The condition is usually diagnosed before the baby is six months old. A physical exam may reveal signs of dehydration. The doctor may detect the abnormal pylorus, which feels like an olive within the abdomen, when pressing over the stomach. An ultrasound of the abdomen may be the first imaging test performed. Other tests may include a barium X-ray to show the shape of the stomach and pylorus.
Treatment
The first form of treatment for pyloric stenosis is to identify and correct any changes in body chemistry using blood tests and intravenous fluids. Pyloric stenosis is always treated with surgery, which almost always cures the condition permanently. The operation, called a pyloromyotomy, divides the thickened outer muscle, while leaving the internal layers of the pylorus intact. This opens a wider channel to allow the contents of the stomach to pass more easily into the intestines.
A minimally invasive approach to abdominal surgery, called laparoscopy is generally the first choice of surgery for pyloric stenosis. To perform laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon inserts a rigid tube (called a trocar) into the abdominal cavity through a small incision (cut). The tube allows the surgeon to place a small camera into the abdomen and observe the structures within on an external monitor. The abdomen is inflated with carbon dioxide gas, which creates room to view the contents of the abdomen and to perform the operation. Additional rigid tubes are placed through small incisions and used to insert small surgical instruments into the abdomen. These instruments are used together with the camera to perform the operation. Tubes and instruments are removed when the operation is finished and the incisions are closed with sutures (stitches) that are absorbed by the body over time.  
Laparoscopic pyloromyotomy generally involves the use of two or three trocars, and therefore usually requires two or three small incisions. If the surgeon decides that a laparoscopic operation is not the best way to treat the problems that are found in the operating room, then the operation will be changed (converted) to use an older surgical technique. Conversion to a nonlaparoscopic operation (called an “open procedure”) is rare and requires a larger incision, which may take longer to heal.
Recovery
In general, patients who receive surgical treatment for pyloric stenosis have an excellent recovery and very few suffer any long-term problems as a result of the disease. After surgery, your baby may be fed special fluids for one or two feedings and then breast milk or formula within 24 hours.
The hospital stay following a pyloromyotomy is typically one or two days, and the decision to discharge a patient is based on how well the child is recovering: specifically, if the baby is able to drink breast milk or formula without vomiting and has pain that can be controlled by medications taken by mouth. It is normal for a baby to vomit small amounts during the first day or two after surgery, but this should gradually improve. If your baby continues to vomit after you return home, call your doctor, because this may indicate continued blockage that is preventing the stomach from emptying normally.
Following all operations, parents or caregivers will be provided with a list of instructions, including specific warning signs that require communication with the surgical team or the attention of a doctor (either in an emergency department or a pediatrician’s office). Parents and other caregivers should refer first to written discharge instructions and use the telephone numbers provided to reach the pediatric surgery team to discuss any problems. These instructions are provided for specific patients after considering their medical conditions, the operation performed and how well the patient is recovering. Therefore, the instructions received at the time of discharge (or afterward over the phone or in the Pediatric Surgery Clinic) are the best resource for parents and caregivers if questions arise. In general, the following findings should cause concern and require a patient to be seen by a doctor:
Fever greater than 101.3 F by oral or rectal thermometer
Spreading redness, drainage (leaking fluid) from the surgical wounds that looks like pus.
Increased bloody drainage from wound.  Small amounts of yellow, pink, or blood-streaked drainage that is absorbed by the wound’s dressing is normal, and should go away in three to five days.
Increasing pain that does not improve with medications prescribed at discharge.
Nausea and vomiting that prevents the child from drinking clear fluids – this can be associated with certain kinds of pain medication or antibiotics and may improve if these medications are taken with food.
The patient cannot move his or her bowels.  Some medications cause constipation, so the surgical team may prescribe stool softeners or mild laxatives to help with bowel movements.  If these treatments are ineffective, there may be a more serious problem."
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis,"What is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis?
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a disease characterized by recurrent wart-like growths on the surface of the vocal cords or tissue around the vocal cords. RRP is caused by specific types of the human papilloma virus (HPV) and is typically benign; however, it tends to recur because the virus persists in the tissue even after the growths are removed.
The location of the papilloma determines what symptoms are experienced: Growths on the vocal cords often cause voice changes, and if the lesions become very large they can cause trouble breathing.
How is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis diagnosed?
Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis can be suspected based on how the vocal cords look on exam. A biopsy is often performed to both confirm the diagnosis of RRP and also to make sure that the lesions show no precancerous changes.
Recurrent Respiratory Papillomatosis Treatment
Treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis centers on careful removal of the lesions without damaging the underlying components of the vocal cords that allow vibration and voice production. Our experts have expertise in treating RRP lesions with lasers, which allows precise removal of the lesions while limiting long-term damage to normal vocal fold tissue. KTP (potassium titanyl phosphate) laser treatments can be performed in-office or in the operating room — the size and location of the lesions will help you and your treatment team to decide which approach is most appropriate for you. Other treatments designed to be used with surgery are available (antiviral or blood vessel-growth limiting medications) and are a subject of ongoing research — your treatment team will discuss whether these additional treatments are appropriate for you.
While surgery treats the symptoms of RRP by removing or reducing the size of the lesions, it does not treat the underlying cause (HPV infection). RRP commonly causes recurrent lesions, so it is important to get frequent examinations and if necessary, undergo multiple surgeries to limit the effects of RRP on the voice box.

Red blood cell aplasia,"What is red blood cell aplasia?
Red blood cells deliver oxygen from the lungs to body tissues. Pure red blood cell aplasia (PRCA) describes a type of anemia brought about by the marrow’s inability to produce these cells. An autoimmune disease, PRCA can result from drugs, viral infections, herpes, parvovirus B19 (fifth disease), hepatitis or HIV. Children can also be born with PRCA (Blackfan-Diamond syndrome).
Platelet disorders, ITP (idiopathic), thrombocytopenia, thrombocytosis and TTP are all PRCAs.
Treatment
Considered an autoimmune disease, PRCA responds to immunosuppressant treatment."
Red blood cell disorders,"What are red blood cell disorders?
There are multiple disorders of the red blood cells, including hemoglobinopathies, cytoskeletal abnormalities (spherocytosis and other membranopathies) and enzymopathies.
Hemoglobinopathies are a group of rare, inherited disorders involving abnormal structure of the hemoglobin molecule. These disorders include hemoglobin C disease, hemoglobin S-C disease, sickle cell anemia and various types of thalassemia."
Respiratory distress syndrome,"What is respiratory distress syndrome?
Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a breathing problem that sometimes affects babies born six weeks or more before their due dates. Their lungs aren't developed enough to make surfactant, a liquid that coats the inside of the lungs and keeps them open so that the baby can breathe in air once he or she is born. RDS is different from bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), another breathing condition that affects premature babies. While RDS usually develops in the first 24 hours after birth, BPD usually develops within the next week or two.
Symptoms
Rapid, shallow breathing
Sharp pulling in of the chest below the ribs with each breath taken in
Grunting sounds during exhalation
Flaring of the nostrils during breathing
Diagnosis
Tests include:
A chest X-ray, which also can identify complications like a collapsed lung that may require urgent treatment
Blood tests to see whether the baby has enough oxygen in his or her blood (These tests also can rule out infection and sepsis as a cause of the breathing problems.)
Echocardiogram to rule out congenital heart defects as the cause of the breathing problems
Treatment
The most important treatments for RDS are:
Surfactant replacement therapy
Breathing support
Prognosis
Thanks to recent medical advances, most babies with RDS who weigh more than two pounds at birth now survive and have no long-term health or development problems."
Respiratory failure,"What is respiratory failure?
Respiratory failure, also known as respiratory acidosis, is a condition that occurs when the lungs cannot remove all of the carbon dioxide the body produces. As a result, body fluids become too acidic. 
Symptoms
Symptoms may include: 
Confusion 
Easy fatigue 
Lethargy 
Shortness of breath 
Sleepiness 
Diagnosis
Exams and tests to diagnose respiratory failure include:
A chest X-ray or CT scan 
Pulmonary function tests 
Arterial blood gas test 
Treatment
Treatment is aimed at the underlying lung disease, and may include: 
Bronchodilator drugs to reverse some airway obstruction 
Methods to stop smoking 
Noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation, or mechanical ventilation if needed 
Oxygen if the blood oxygen level is low 
Prognosis
How well you do depends on the disease causing respiratory failure. "
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),"Respiratory syncytial virus, commonly known as RSV, is a common respiratory infection that affects children and adults. Most children contract RSV before the age of 2. RSV is not usually a serious condition; however, high risk groups — especially infants — can develop serious cases and require a hospital visit. 
Dr. Joseph Collaco, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins Children's Center, offers his insight on preventing and treating this infection. 
What is RSV?
RSV is a viral infection that can lead to inflammation of the respiratory tract and lungs. The peak time for RSV to spread is during fall and winter. Most children and adults with RSV will have mild symptoms similar to the common cold and recover in one to two weeks. In children younger than 1 year, RSV is the most common cause of inflammation of the lungs, such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia.
Who is at Risk for RSV? 
People of any age can contract RSV, but those at the highest risk of complications include:
Premature infants and children under age 2
Infants under the age of 6 months
Children under age 2 with chronic lung diseases, such as asthma
Children under age 2 with congenital (from birth) heart problems
Children with neuromuscular disorders that cause difficulty in clearing mucus secretions or swallowing
Adults and children with weakened immune systems due to illnesses or medical conditions
Older adults with heart or lung problems
RSV Causes and Spread
RSV is highly contagious. It can be spread by coming into contact with fluids from an infected person’s nose or mouth. This can happen by inhaling the droplets of the person’s cough or sneeze, or by touching a contaminated surface before touching the nose, eyes or mouth. Outbreaks often occur in classrooms, community centers and child care centers.
In most cases, people with RSV are contagious for three to eight days after their first exposure. However, if an infant or someone with a weak immune system contracts the disease, they may be contagious for up to four weeks.
RSV Symptoms
Typically, symptoms of RSV start within four to six days after exposure. The early symptoms are often mild, and similar to those of a common cold. Common symptoms may include:
Runny nose
Coughing
Sneezing
Wheezing
Decreased appetite
Low fever
In some cases, the infection will lead to severe respiratory disease in infants. Contact a doctor if you notice:
High fever
Worsening cough
Wheezing
Nostril flaring or chest muscles visibly pulling in and out, signaling breathing issues
Irregular or rapid breathing
Blue coloring of skin (lips and fingers)
Tiredness
Trouble eating, drinking or swallowing
RSV Diagnosis
RSV can be diagnosed by a doctor after viewing symptoms and findings from a physical exam. Additional tests, such as nasal swab or nasal wash may also be used to diagnose.
RSV Treatment
For those with mild symptoms, no specific treatment is necessary. Over-the-counter pain relievers or fever reducers can help manage symptoms. Aspirin should NOT be given to children or teenagers during viral illnesses.
People with RSV should drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.
Children with severe symptoms may require a hospital visit to receive more fluids, oxygen therapy or use of a ventilator breathing machine. Antiviral medications may be used in the treatment of some patients with severe cases in the hospital.
RSV Prevention
RSV easily spreads from person to person. The proper steps to take to avoid the spread of RSV, especially if experiencing cold-like symptoms are:
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands.
Avoid close contact with others (especially sick people), such as shaking hands, sharing eating or drinking utensils, and kissing.
RSV Prevention for Babies
The following steps are recommended by doctors to prevent RSV in babies and infants, especially among high-risk children:
Wash their hands for at least 20 seconds.
Disinfect surfaces that people come into contact with regularly, such as door knobs, handles and countertops.
Cover the mouth and nose while coughing.
Avoid exposure to tobacco smoke.
When possible, avoid or restrict group settings during RSV season.
Your child may be prescribed a medication known as palivizumab to minimize or prevent serious RSV disease among high-risk infants and children less than 2 years of age. If prescribed, palivizumab is given by injection monthly during the RSV season. Palivizumab is not a vaccine, but protects against RSV using virus-fighting antibodies. Talk with your child’s doctors to determine if they would be a candidate for this therapy."
Restless legs syndrome,"What is RLS?
Restless legs syndrome is a problem (disorder) that affects the nervous system and muscles. It causes unpleasant sensations in the legs. The sensations are described as:
Creeping
Crawling
Tingling
Pulling
You usually have these sensations in the calf, but they may be felt anywhere from the thigh to the ankle. One or both of your legs may be affected. Some people may have the sensations in their arms. With RLS, you have an irresistible urge to move the affected limb when the sensations occur. Moving often briefly relieves the limb discomfort.
Sleep problems are common with RLS because of the difficulty it causes in getting to sleep. Severe daytime fatigue can also be a big problem.
What causes RLS?
The cause of RLS is still unknown. Some cases are believed to be inherited. Some cases have been linked with nerve damage in the legs from diabetes, kidney problems, iron deficiency, certain medicines, pregnancy, sleep disorders, and alcoholism.
It's estimated that as many as 1 in 10 people in the U.S. may have RLS in varying degrees of severity.
What are the symptoms of RLS?
Sensations occur when you lie down or sit for a prolonged time. This causes:
The need to move the legs for temporary relief of symptoms by:
Stretching or bending
Rubbing the legs
Tossing or turning in bed
Getting up and pacing
Worsening symptoms when lying down, especially when trying to fall asleep at night, or during other forms of inactivity, including just sitting
A tendency to feel the most discomfort late in the day and at night
How is RLS diagnosed?
Your healthcare provider can diagnose RLS based on your signs and symptoms, a complete medical history, and a physical exam. In addition, tests, such as lab tests or a sleep study, may be done. Currently, there is not a definitive test to diagnose RLS.
How is RLS treated?
Your healthcare provider will consider your age, overall health, and other factors when advising treatment for you.
Your healthcare provider will treat any underlying disorder you have that affects RLS. An example is iron deficiency.
Treatment options for RLS may include:
Following good sleep habits
Stopping activities that worsen symptoms
Giving up caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco (they may make symptoms worse)
Regular, moderate exercise
Maintaining a well-balanced diet
Treating underlying chronic conditions
Medicines. These include:
Dopaminergic medicines. These are medicines that increase dopamine and are largely used to treat Parkinson disease.
Benzodiazepines such as clonazepam and diazepam
Opioids. These are used only used in severe cases. They include codeine, propoxyphene, and oxycodone.
Anticonvulsants such as gabapentin and pregabalin
Iron therapy. This is given only if iron deficiency is present (some people respond to iron therapy).
Talk with your healthcare provider for more information on how RLS is treated.
Key points about RLS
RLS is a disorder that causes unpleasant sensations in the legs. The cause of RLS is still unknown.
With RLS, you have an irresistible urge to move the affected limb when the sensations occur.
Your healthcare provider can diagnose RLS based on your symptoms, a health history, and a physical exam, but there is no definitive test to diagnose RLS.
Medicine and lifestyle changes can help ease RLS symptoms.
Next steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your healthcare provider:

Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions."
Restrictive lung disease,"What is restrictive lung disease?
Restrictive lung disease, a decrease in the total volume of air that the lungs are able to hold, is often due to a decrease in the elasticity of the lungs themselves or caused by a problem related to the expansion of the chest wall during inhalation. Examples of restrictive lung diseases include asbestosis, sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis.
Symptoms
Symptoms of restrictive lung disease include cough, shortness of breath, wheezing and chest pain.
Diagnosis
Diagnostic testing for lung disease may include any of the following:
Pulmonary function tests
Chest X-ray
CT scans
Bronchoscopy
Pulse oximetry
Treatment
As with diagnostic testing, treatment of lung disease depends on many factors, such as the type and stage of disease, family history, patient’s medical history and the health and age of the patient. Any of the following may be used for treating lung disease:
Inhalers
Expectorants
Antibiotics
Oxygen therapy
Chemotherapy
Lung transplantation"
Right middle lobe syndrome,"What is right middle lobe syndrome?
Right middle lobe syndrome (RMLS) generally refers to atelectasis in the right middle lobe of the lung.
Symptoms
Symptoms begin in early childhood, usually in children from one to two years old. Symptom frequency decreases in later childhood, but the interval between onset of symptoms and diagnosis widely varies. The most common symptoms include:
Persistent or recurrent cough
Intermittent wheezing
Dyspnea
History of recurrent or chronic pneumonia
Diagnosis
Right middle lobe syndrome is essentially a radiographic diagnosis, and physical findings widely vary.
Auscultation of the lungs may reveal a fine wheeze, rales or diffuse rhonchi, ranging from decreased aeration and dullness to percussion in the region of the right middle lobe.
Treatment
Chest physical therapy and postural drainage are the hallmarks of therapy.

Sacroiliitis,"What is sacroiliitis?
Sacroiliitis is an inflammation of one or both of the sacroiliac joints that connect your lower spine and pelvis. It is associated with a group of diseases that cause inflammatory arthritis of the spine. See spondyloarthropathy.
Symptoms
Low back pain
Joint inflammation
Diagnosis
A physical exam is required for diagnosis.
Treatment
Treatment can include rest, medications and physical therapy."
Scleroderma,"Scleroderma is a group of diseases with a common symptom: hardening and tightening of the skin. There are two types of scleroderma: localized and systemic. Localized scleroderma only affects the skin and systemic scleroderma affects the skin, the blood vessels and internal organs.
Scleroderma is a rheumatic disease, which means patients may have inflammation, pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, muscles and/or tissues. It’s also an autoimmune disease.
Scleroderma affects many more women than men, and it’s typically found in people between the ages of 30 and 50. As many as 300,000 people in the United States have been diagnosed with scleroderma, and as many as 10,000 die each year from the most serious forms of the disease.

Scoliosis,"What is scoliosis?
The spine is made up of a stack of rectangular-shaped building blocks called vertebrae. When viewed from behind, the spine normally appears straight. However, a spine affected by scoliosis is curved — often appearing like an S or C — with a rotation of the vertebrae. This curvature gives the appearance that the person is leaning to one side.
Scoliosis is determined when the curvature of the spine measures 10 degrees or greater on an X-ray. Spinal curvature from scoliosis may occur on the right or left side of the spine, or on both sides in different sections. Both the thoracic (mid) and lumbar (lower) spine may be affected by scoliosis. Scoliosis is a type of spinal deformity.
In more than 80 percent of cases, the cause of scoliosis is unknown — a condition called idiopathic scoliosis. In other cases, scoliosis may develop as a result of degeneration of the spinal discs, as seen with arthritis, osteoporosis or as a hereditary condition that tends to run in families.
What are the different types of scoliosis?
Congenital Scoliosis
In congenital scoliosis, spinal curvature develops because of misshapen vertebrae. The diagnosis of congenital scoliosis may be made in early infancy if outward signs are present, but many cases are diagnosed later in childhood.
As a child grows, scoliosis may worsen, and asymmetries in the body may develop. Typically, congenital scoliosis is treated with a “watch and wait” approach. Surgery is considered only if a curve is clearly getting worse and the child is facing ongoing deformity and risk of future pain.
Idiopathic Scoliosis
Doctors, nurses and scientists have been studying the natural history and genetics of scoliosis for decades, but to this day, the cause of idiopathic scoliosis is still unknown. But we do know that the most common time for idiopathic scoliosis to develop is at the onset of adolescence, or around the age of 10. We also know that growth can make it worse, and we should be most concerned about scoliosis in a child that has significant growth remaining.
When diagnosed in children 2 or younger, this type of scoliosis is called infantile idiopathic scoliosis.
Neuromuscular Scoliosis
A child with an underlying neuromuscular condition is at higher risk for developing scoliosis. A straight spine requires normal muscle balance and strength in the torso. In conditions such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida and muscular dystrophy, the muscles are often weak and unbalanced, leading to the development of a spinal curvature.
A child with neuromuscular scoliosis is given the option of wearing a scoliosis brace that may slow or prevent the worsening of the condition. Surgical intervention is offered when the curve has reached the tipping point of 50 degrees. Over time, these curves will continue to worsen, leading to progressive imbalance of the torso. Beyond 80 degrees, breathing challenges develop as space for the lungs decreases.
What are the symptoms of scoliosis?
The following are the most common symptoms of scoliosis. However, each individual may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms may include:
Difference in shoulder height
The head isn't centered with the rest of the body
Difference in hip height or position
Difference in shoulder blade height or position
When standing straight, difference in the way the arms hang beside the body
When bending forward, the sides of the back appear different in height
Prominence or asymmetry in the ribs seen from the front or back
The symptoms of scoliosis may resemble other spinal conditions or deformities, or may be a result of an injury or infection. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.
Symptoms that are not commonly associated with idiopathic scoliosis are back pain, leg pain, and changes in bowel and bladder habits. If a person is experiencing these types of symptoms, he or she requires immediate further medical evaluation by a doctor to determine the cause of the symptoms.
How is scoliosis diagnosed?
Early detection of scoliosis is most important for successful treatment. In addition to a complete medical history and physical examination, an X-ray is the primary diagnostic tool for scoliosis. In establishing a diagnosis of scoliosis, the doctor measures the degree of spinal curvature on the X-ray.
The following additional diagnostic procedures may be performed for nonidiopathic curvatures, atypical curve patterns or congenital scoliosis:
MRI. This diagnostic procedure uses a combination of large magnets and a computer to produce detailed images of organs and structures within the body.
CT scan. This diagnostic imaging procedure uses a combination of X-rays and computer technology to produce horizontal, or axial, images (often called slices) of the body. A CT scan shows detailed images of any part of the body, including the bones, muscles, fat and organs. CT scans are more detailed than general X-rays.
How is scoliosis treated?
The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the curve and prevent deformity. Observation and repeated examinations — also referred to as the “watch and wait” approach — may be necessary to determine if the spine is continuing to curve. These are used when a person has a curve that is less than 20 degrees and who is still growing.
For actively growing children with scoliosis curves between 20 and 50 degrees, bracing is recommended. An external torso brace, or TLSO, is worn for a prescribed number of hours. The brace applies corrective pressure to the growing spine, preventing further worsening of the scoliosis. Read more about the effects of bracing.
Surgery is a recommended treatment option for a child with severe scoliosis or a curve that has worsened to more than 50 degrees. At the Johns Hopkins Children’s Center, our team of pediatric spine surgeons, nurses and anesthesiologists use a family-centered approach to develop a plan for the care of your child. We are a high-volume scoliosis center, and we are constantly learning and adopting best practices for the operative and postoperative care of children with scoliosis.

Sepsis,"What is sepsis?
Sepsis is a life-threatening infection of the bloodstream by toxin-producing bacteria, which can develop anywhere in the body. Sepsis can accompany meningitis, infections of the bone in hospitalized patients, intravenous lines, surgical wounds or breaks in the skin. In sepsis, blood pressure drops, resulting in shock. Major organs and systems stop functioning normally.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Fever
Confusion or delirium
Rapid heart beat
Hyperventilation
Warm Skin
Shaking
Skin rash
Decreased urine output
Diagnosis
A diagnosis of septsis is confirmed by a blood culture positive for bacteria, a white blood cell count either too high or low and/or other laboratory tests. 
Treatment
Treatment for sepsis requires prompt intravenous treatment with a broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotic. The original source of the infection must be identified and then treated with the appropriate antibiotics."
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS),"What is SARS?
Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)  is a rapidly spreading, potentially fatal infectious viral disease.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), SARS was recognized as a global threat in March 2003. The viral disease first appeared in Southern China in November, 2002 and spread to more than 24 countries in Asia, Europe, North America, and South America. There have not been any new cases of SARS since 2004, and the risk is relatively low.
Although they were dealing with a newly-discovered virus that behaved differently than other known viruses, world health officials were able to contain the SARS epidemic within a few short months. For another SARS outbreak to emerge, the SARS virus would need to be transmitted from an animal source, a lab accident, or humans who have not been rapidly diagnosed, isolated, and treated. China has reported a few cases of SARS since December 2003. Chinese health care professionals have heightened awareness of symptoms and are prepared to use proper infection control measures to prevent another outbreak.
What causes SARS?
A virus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) causes the illness. Coronaviruses commonly cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory illness in humans, but can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, liver, and neurologic diseases in animals.
As researchers quickly rushed to stop the spread of SARS in 2003, they learned more about the characteristics of SARS-CoV, which had never been identified before. While they still have not confirmed the disease's origin, many believe SARS-CoV first occurred in animals and then spread to humans.
In children, the virus' incubation period from exposure to infection is 2 to 7 days, although infection has taken as long as 10 days in some cases. However, not everyone exposed to the disease becomes ill.
Scientists from around the world are collaborating to gain a better understanding of the cause of SARS.
What are the signs and symptoms of SARS?
SARS can be difficult to recognize in children because it mimics other respiratory diseases, such as influenza. It generally begins with a fever higher than 100.4° F (38° C) and progresses to include one or more of the following symptoms:
Headache
Overall feeling of discomfort
Body aches and chills
Sore throat
Cough
Pneumonia 
Difficulty breathing
Shortness of breath
Hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the blood)
Diarrhea (for 10 to 20 percent of patients)
There is currently no test to diagnose SARS. The symptoms of SARS may look like other medical conditions. Always consult your child's health care provider for a diagnosis.
How does SARS spread?
SARS-CoV spreads from one person to another mainly through close contact with someone who is infected with SARS. When a person with SARS coughs or sneezes without covering his or her mouth, respiratory droplets containing living virus can spray up to 3 feet and invade the mucous membranes of another person. People in close contact with someone with SARS are most at risk, which means they live or work with someone with SARS or have direct contact with the person through kissing, hugging, or sharing eating utensils.
The virus also can spread when a child touches an object with infectious droplets on it and then touches his or her mouth, nose, or eyes. It is not known whether SARS can spread more broadly through the air.
Research suggests that children with SARS are infectious only when they are having symptoms, such as fever or cough. They are most infectious during their second week of illness. As a precaution, the CDC recommends that people with SARS stay in isolation at home or in the hospital to keep others from getting sick. They should stay home from school for 10 days after their symptoms have gone away.
Some children have been exposed to SARS, but have not become ill or may not yet be ill. In 2003, health authorities in the U.S. and Canada recommended that exposed children have their temperature and health status monitored for 10 days. In addition, these individuals were asked to follow careful precautions to prevent spreading the virus, such as staying home, washing hands frequently, covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing, and contacting a health care provider should symptoms appear.
What is the treatment for SARS?
Research is currently underway to develop an effective antiviral drug for SARS-CoV. Until then, people with SARS may receive mainly supportive therapy, with oxygen and fluids to help ease symptoms, and antibiotics to help prevent or treat secondary infections. Antibiotics do not, however, kill the SARS virus.
How can SARS be prevented?
Currently, no vaccine is available to prevent SARS. The CDC recommends taking the following steps with your children to prevent SARS. They should:
Wash their hands regularly with warm water and soap.
Avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
Use disposable tissues instead of their hands to cover their mouths when they cough, and throw tissues away immediately after use.
As parents, you should follow public health recommendations if you are in the area of an epidemic. 
Experts from CDC and WHO rely on rapid diagnosis of SARS to prevent it from spreading and infecting additional people. Worldwide advisories help identify individuals at risk of developing SARS because of exposure to ill people. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, quarantines were used as a public health measure to stop the spread of SARS.
CDC and WHO continue to partner in a global effort to address SARS and prevent future outbreaks.
Always consult your child's health care provider for more information."
Shaken baby syndrome,"What is shaken baby syndrome?
Shaken baby syndrome is a type of inflicted traumatic brain injury that happens when a baby is violently shaken. A baby has weak neck muscles and a large, heavy head. Shaking makes the fragile brain bounce back and forth inside the skull and causes bruising, swelling and bleeding, which can lead to permanent, severe brain damage or death. Shaken baby injuries usually occur in children younger than two years old but may be seen in children up to the age of five.
Symptoms
The characteristic injuries of shaken baby syndrome are subdural hemorrhages (bleeding in the brain), retinal hemorrhages (bleeding inside the eye), damage to the spinal cord and neck and fractures of the ribs and bones. These injuries may not be immediately noticeable. Symptoms of shaken baby syndrome include:
Breathing problems
Convulsions
Extreme irritability
Lethargy
Poor feeding
Vomiting and pale or bluish skin
Treatment
Emergency treatment for a baby who has been shaken usually includes life-sustaining measures, such as respiratory support and surgery, to stop internal bleeding and bleeding in the brain. Doctors may use brain scans, including MRI and CT scans, to make a more definite diagnosis.
Prognosis
In comparison with accidental traumatic brain injury in infants, shaken baby injuries have a much worse prognosis. Damage to the retina of the eye can cause blindness. The majority of infants who survive severe shaking will have some form of neurological or mental disability, such as cerebral palsy or mental retardation, which may not be fully apparent before six years of age. Children with shaken baby syndrome may require lifelong medical care."
Short stature,"What is short stature?
Short stature is a general term used to describe a condition in which a child or a teen's height is well below the average height of his or her peers. Short stature typically means that a person's height is below that of the shortest 3 percent to 5 percent of children of the same age and sex. Short stature could be idiopathic (with no known cause), an inherited trait or a symptom of one of a number of underlying disorders. Many disorders can cause short stature, including achondroplasia, hormone deficiency, delayed puberty, Cushing’s disease, malnutrition, malabsorption disorders, such as celiac disease, and others. A child must be examined by a health care provider if short stature is suspected or present. 
Symptoms
Short stature does not cause any symptoms other than the obvious finding of short height. If there is an underlying disorder present, there may be symptoms related to that condition. 
Diagnosis
A physical exam followed by measurement of height, weight, arm and leg length are the first steps to diagnosis. These will be followed by questions about family history, which will give clues to whether the short stature could be the result of an inherited condition. The child’s medical and physical history will be detailed as well. X-rays and blood tests are typically ordered to determine whether the short stature is caused by mere growth delay or a more complex condition.
Treatment
Treatment of short stature depends on the underlying cause. For example, if the cause is a chronic disease, such as diabetes or sickle cell anemia, these conditions should be treated first."
Shortness of breath,"What is shortness of breath?
When you are short of breath, you may feel like you can't get enough air or your chest may feel tight. Sometimes the feeling is worse when you are physically active or when you lie down flat.
Symptoms
You may have other symptoms such as a cough, chest pains or fever.
Shortness of breath can be caused by the following:
Asthma
Other lung diseases, including emphysema
Heart failure that causes fluid to collect in the lungs
Panic attacks
If you are short of breath with a cough and/or fever, you may have a chest infection or pneumonia. Less common causes of breathing problems are lung cancer, a blood clot in the lungs, air leakage around the lungs and scarring of the lung tissue.
Diagnosis
To find the cause of your shortness of breath, your doctor may order a chest X-ray or an electrocardiogram (ECG). During this test, your doctor will have you lie down so your heart can be monitored. The ECG machine makes a picture called a tracing that shows your heart's electrical signals. Your doctor may measure your breathing and the oxygen level in your blood. You also may need to have a blood test.
Treatment
In severe cases of difficulty breathing, hospitalization may be required. Many different medications, aimed at treating the cause of breathing difficulty, may be used in treatment. 
In situations where the blood oxygen level is significantly low, supplemental oxygen is helpful. High doses of supplemental oxygen may be hazardous for some patients, however, and is not necessary in all cases of shortness of breath."
Sickle cell disease,"What is sickle cell disease?
Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. It is marked by flawed hemoglobin. That’s the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the tissues of the body. So, sickle cell disease interferes with the delivery of oxygen to the tissues.
Red blood cells with normal hemoglobin are smooth, disk-shaped, and flexible, like doughnuts without holes. They can move through the blood vessels easily. Cells with sickle cell hemoglobin are stiff and sticky. When they lose their oxygen, they form into the shape of a sickle or crescent, like the letter C. These cells stick together and can’t easily move through the blood vessels. This can block small blood vessels and the movement of healthy, normal oxygen-carrying blood. The blockage can cause pain.
Normal red blood cells can live up to 120 days. But, sickle cells only live for about 10 to 20 days. Also, sickle cells may be destroyed by the spleen because of their shape and stiffness. The spleen helps filter the blood of infections. Sickled cells get stuck in this filter and die. With less healthy red blood cells circulating in the body, you can become chronically anemic. The sickled cells also damage the spleen. This puts you are at greater at risk for infections.
What causes sickle cell disease?
Sickle cell is an inherited disease caused by a defect in a gene.
A person will be born with sickle cell disease only if two genes are inherited—one from the mother and one from the father.
A person who inherits just one gene is healthy and said to be a ""carrier"" of the disease. A carrier has an increased chance of having a child with sickle cell disease if he or she has a child with another carrier. 
For parents who are each carriers of a sickle cell gene, there is a 1 in 4, or a 25 % chance of having a child with sickle cell disease.
What are the risk factors for sickle cell disease?
Having a family history of sickle cell disease increases your risk for the disease. In the United States, it mainly affects African Americans.
What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease?
The following is a list of symptoms and complications associated with sickle cell disease. However, each person may experience symptoms differently. Symptoms and complications may include:
Anemia. Because sickled cells are short-lived or destroyed, there are less red blood cells available in the body. This results in anemia. Severe anemia can make you feel dizzy, short of breath, and tired.
Pain crisis, or sickle crisis. This occurs when the flow of blood is blocked to an area because the sickled cells have become stuck in the blood vessel. The pain can occur anywhere, but most often occurs in the chest, arms, and legs. Infants and young children may have painful swelling of the fingers and toes. Interruption in blood flow may also cause tissue death.
Acute chest syndrome. This occurs when sickling occurs in the chest. This can be life-threatening. It often occurs suddenly, when the body is under stress from infection, fever, or dehydration. The sickled cells stick together and block the flow of oxygen in the tiny vessels in the lungs. It resembles pneumonia and can include fever, pain, and a violent cough.
Splenic sequestration (pooling). Crises are a result of sickle cells pooling in the spleen. This can cause a sudden drop in hemoglobin and can be life-threatening if not treated promptly. The spleen can also become enlarged and painful from the increase in blood volume. After repeated episodes,  the spleen becomes scarred, and permanently damaged. Most children, by age 8, do not have a working spleen either from surgical removal, or from repeated episodes of splenic sequestration. The risk of infection is a major concern of children without a working spleen. Infection is the major cause of death in children younger than age 5 in this population.
Stroke. This is another sudden and severe complication of people with sickle cell disease. The misshapen cells can block the major blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. Any interruption in the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain can result in severe brain damage. If you have one stroke from sickle cell anemia, you are more likely to have a second and third stroke.
Jaundice, or yellowing of the skin, eyes, and mouth. Jaundice is a common sign and symptom of sickle disease. Sickle cells do not live as long as normal red blood cells and, therefore, they are dying faster than the liver can filter them out. Bilirubin (which causes the yellow color) from these broken down cells builds up in the system causing jaundice.
Priapism.  This is a painful obstruction of the blood vessels in the penis by sickle cells. If not promptly treated, it can result in impotence.
The symptoms of sickle cell disease may look like other blood disorders or medical problems. Always consult your health care provider for a diagnosis.
How is sickle cell disease diagnosed?
Along with a complete medical history and physical exam, you may have blood and other tests.
Many states routinely screen newborns for sickle cell so that treatment can begin as soon as possible. Early diagnosis and treatment can reduce the risk of complications.
Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a blood test that can determine if a person is a carrier of sickle cell, or has any of the diseases associated with the sickle cell gene.
How is sickle cell disease treated?
Your doctor will consider your age, overall health and other factors when determining the best treatment for you.
Early diagnosis and prevention of complications is critical in sickle cell disease treatment. Treatment aims to prevent organ damage including strokes, prevent infection, and treat symptoms. Treatment may include:
Pain medications. This is for sickle cell crises.
Drinking plenty of water daily (8 to 10 glasses). This is to prevent and treat pain crises. In some situations, intravenous fluids may be required.  
Blood transfusions. These may help treat anemia and prevent stroke. They are also used to dilute the sickled hemoglobin with normal hemoglobin to treat chronic pain, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, and other emergencies.
Vaccinations and antibiotics. These are used to prevent infections.
Folic acid. Folic acid will help prevent severe anemia.
Hydroxyurea. This medication helps reduce the frequency of pain crises and acute chest syndrome. It may also help decrease the need for blood transfusions. The long-term effects of the medication are unknown.
Regular eye exams. These are done to screen for retinopathy.  
Bone marrow transplant. Bone marrow transplants can cure some people with sickle cell disease. The decision to have this procedure is based on the severity of the disease and ability to find a suitable bone marrow donor. These decisions need to be discussed with your doctor and are only done at specialized medical centers.
What are the complications of sickle cell disease?
Any and all major organs are affected by sickle cell disease. The liver, heart, kidneys, gallbladder, eyes, bones, and joints can suffer damage from the abnormal function of the sickle cells and their inability to flow through the small blood vessels correctly. Problems may include the following:
Increased infections
Leg ulcers
Bone damage
Early gallstones
Kidney damage and loss of body water in the urine
Eye damage
Multiple organ failure
Living with sickle cell disease
Sickle cell disease is a life-long condition. Although the complications of sickle cell disease may not be able to be prevented entirely, living a healthy life-style can reduce some of the complications.
It is important to eat a healthy diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein, and drink lots of fluids.
Do not take decongestants because they cause constriction of blood vessels and could trigger a crisis.
Other factors that may trigger a crisis include high altitudes, cold weather, swimming in cold water, and heavy physical labor.
Avoid infections by getting an annual flu shot, washing your hands frequently, avoiding those who are sick, and getting regular dental exams.
Key points
Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder marked by defective hemoglobin.
It inhibits the ability of hemoglobin in red blood cells to carry oxygen.
Sickle cells tend to stick together, blocking small blood vessels causing painful and damaging complications.
Sickle cell disease is treated with pain medications as needed, drinking 8 to 10 glasses of water each day, blood transfusions, and medications.

Sjogren’s syndrome,"Patience is key when diagnosing Sjögren’s syndrome. The main symptoms — a persistent feeling of dry eyes and dry mouth — can have many different causes and develop gradually, leading to a delay in considering Sjögren’s syndrome as the cause. These dryness symptoms can occur in other conditions — including chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia — and can be side effects of a variety of commonly used medications. On average, it takes three years from the time symptoms are noticed to reach a Sjögren’s syndrome diagnosis.
How Is Sjögren’s Syndrome Diagnosed?
Unfortunately, there isn’t one test that can tell if you have Sjögren’s syndrome. Your doctor must carefully review all of your symptoms to rule out any other potential causes. He or she may send you to see specialists, such as a rheumatologist, ophthalmologist or dentist and/or oral medicine specialist to look for key elements of the disease such as an insufficient tear film on your eyes, decreased saliva production, salivary gland inflammation and an underlying autoimmune disorder.
Diagnosing Sjögren’s syndrome requires gathering a lot of information, which your doctors will collect from a combination of tests on your eyes and mouth, blood and urine tests, and biopsies. These will be in addition to taking a medical history and performing a physical exam, the results of which may determine the tests your doctors will perform.
Once they establish that you have Sjögren’s syndrome, they’ll perform more tests to understand the severity of the disease and its effect on other parts of your body."
Skin cancer,"There are several types of skin cancers besides melanoma. Kristin Bibee, M.D., Ph.D., a dermatologic surgeon at Johns Hopkins, describes nonmelanoma skin cancers, what to look for and what to expect."
Sleep apnea,"What is sleep apnea?
Sleep apnea is a serious, potentially life-threatening condition. It is far more common than previously thought. Sleep apnea happens in all age groups and genders, although it is more common in men. It is estimated that as many as 18 million Americans have sleep apnea.
Sleep apnea is a breathing disorder characterized by brief interruptions of breathing during sleep. There are two types of sleep apnea:
Central sleep apnea happens when the brain fails to send the appropriate signals to the muscles to start breathing. Central sleep apnea is less common than obstructive sleep apnea.
Obstructive sleep apnea happens when air can’t flow into or out of the nose or mouth although efforts to breathe continue.
Sleep apnea is characterized by a number of involuntary breathing pauses or ""apneic events"" during a single night's sleep. There may be as many as 20 to 30 or more events per hour. These events are usually accompanied by snoring between apnea episodes. But, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea. Sleep apnea may also be characterized by choking sensations. The frequent interruptions of deep, restorative sleep often lead to early morning headaches and excessive daytime sleepiness.
During the apneic event, you can't breathe in oxygen or exhale carbon dioxide. This results in low levels of oxygen and increased levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. This alerts the brain to resume breathing and cause an arousal. With each arousal, a signal is sent from the brain to the upper airway muscles to open the airway. Breathing is resumed, often with a loud snort or gasp. Frequent arousals, although necessary for breathing to restart, prevent restorative, deep sleep.
Early recognition and treatment of sleep apnea is important, as it may be associated with:
Irregular heartbeat
High blood pressure
Heart attack
Stroke
Daytime sleepiness
Increased risk of motor vehicle accidents"
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis,"What is the capital femoral epiphysis?
The femur is the long bone of the thigh. The end of the femur that connects with the hip consists of a “ball” (called the femoral head). The ball fits inside of a “cup” that is made up of the pelvic bones and is known as the acetabulum. During growth, the end of the head is known as the epiphysis and is connected to the rest of the femur by the growth plate.
What is slipped capital femoral epiphysis?
Slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) a disorder of adolescents in which the growth plate is damaged and the femoral head moves (“slips”) with respect to the rest of the femur. The head of the femur stays in the cup of the hip joint while the rest of the femur is shifted."
Snoring,"What is snoring? 
Whether you call it sawing logs, or by its medical name, stertor, snoring is common. Snoring occurs when something blocks the flow of air through your mouth and nose, resulting in sounds caused by tissues at the top of your airway striking each other and vibrating.
Symptoms 
Snoring can also be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea, in which the person stops breathing for periods of more than 10 seconds at a time during sleep. Symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea include inattention, hyperactivity, sleepiness or other behavioral problems. If your child snores frequently, have your health care provider check for sleep apnea. In children, obstructive sleep apnea often occurs in association with large tonsils.
Diagnosis 
Heavy snorers, those who snore in any position or are disruptive to the family, should seek medical advice to ensure that sleep apnea is not a problem. The physician will conduct a thorough examination of the nose, mouth, throat, palate and neck. A sleep study may be necessary to determine how serious the snoring is and what effects it has on the snorer’s health.
Treatment 
Treatments include surgery for obstructive sleep apnea and snoring. If surgery is too risky or unwanted, the patient may sleep every night with a nasal mask that delivers air pressure into the throat — this is called continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP. Patients can also reduce snoring by losing weight, cutting down or eliminating alcohol and other sedatives at bedtime and avoiding sleeping flat on their backs.

Solitary kidney,"What is solitary kidney?
Solitary kidney is a condition in which a person has a single kidney instead of two kidneys. A person may be born with one kidney (renal agenesis), have two kidneys but only one functional (renal dysplasia) or lose one kidney to a disease, such as kidney cancer. People who donate one of their kidneys have a solitary kidney.
The kidneys perform the following:
Filter waste from the blood
Help maintain water balance and blood pressure
Keep the proper balance of minerals in the blood
Most people who have one kidney lead normal healthy lives. Some people experience complications. including reduced kidney function and high blood pressure.
Symptoms
High blood pressure
Increased protein in the urine, or proteinuria
Reduced filtering capacity measured by glomerular filtration rate (GFR): A reduced GFR, measured by a blood test, can occur in people with a single kidney. As long as these conditions are under control, they will probably not affect overall health dramatically, but regular monitoring is needed.
Diagnosis
Some people discover they have a single kidney by accident.
An X-ray and/or an ultrasound can reveal a solitary kidney.
To monitor possible strain on the single kidney, regular blood and urine tests are needed.
Treatment
Controlling blood pressure with lifestyle changes and/or medication
Sensible diet and avoiding too much protein to avoid putting strain on the kidney
Avoiding injury is important but the child should still engage in physical activity. Discuss appropriate sports with your doctor.
When to Call for Help
If your child has symptoms, including high blood pressure, blood in the urine or foamy urine, swelling in the face, hands or legs, talk to your pediatrician."
Spina bifida,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Spina bifida is term used to identify a set of conditions that affect the development of the spinal cord and vertebrae.
The three main types of spina bifida are myelomeningocele, lipomeningocele and spina bifida occulta.
Spina bifida is often diagnosed in utero before a baby is born.
Children with spina bifida are often cared for by a variety of medical professionals, including a neurologist, orthopaedist and physical therapist, among others.
Treatment may include surgery, bracing, physical therapy and other forms of medical care based on each child’s needs."
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA),"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disorder affecting the motor neurons—nerve cells that control voluntary muscle movement. These cells are located in the spinal cord.
Because the muscles cannot respond to signals from the nerves, they atrophy — weaken and shrink — from inactivity.
One in every 6,000 babies is born with SMA. It is one of the most prevalent genetic disorders affecting young children and a major cause of death in infancy.
SMA can strike children at any age. SMA in infancy and early childhood is associated with worse outcomes, while patients who develop symptoms later in childhood or in adolescence usually have a more positive prognosis.
SMA does not affect sensory nerves or intellect, but it has been observed that many patients with SMA are highly intelligent."
Spondyloarthropathy,"What is spondyloarthropathy?
Spondyloarthropathy describes a type of chronic inflammatory joint disease called arthropathy. It mimics rheumatoid arthritis, but blood tests are typically negative for rheumatoid factor.
Spondyloarthropathy involves the sacroiliac joints and other joints and organs. See arthropathy.
 "
Staph infection,"What is a staphylococcal infection?
Staphylococcus aureus, or “staph,” are common bacteria that normally live on the skin. The bacteria also live harmlessly in the nasal passages of roughly 30 percent of the U.S. population. Staph can cause infection when they enter the skin through a cut or sore. Infection can also occur when the bacteria move inside of the body through a catheter or breathing tube. 
Staphylococcus aureus, or S. epidermidis, can cause staphylococcal meningitis, an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord caused by; it usually develops as a complication of a surgical procedure or a blood-borne infection. 
Diagnosis
Depending on the extent and severity of your symptoms, your doctor may recommend the following tests:
A skin biopsy and culture from the infected site
Culture of the drainage (fluid) from the infection, to see which organism grows in it
Blood culture
Sputum culture through coughing or bronchoscopy if pneumonia is present or suspected
Urine culture  if a urinary tract infection is present or suspected
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of staph infection. Some require intravenous antibiotics. For a local Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infection, draining the abscess at the doctor's office is usually the only treatment needed. Few antibiotics are available to treat more serious MRSA infections. These include vancomycin (Vancocin, Vancoled), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (Bactrim, Bactrim DS, Septra, Septra DS) and linezolid (Zyvox).
Note: It is critically important to finish all doses of antibiotics you have been given, even if you feel better before the final dose. Unfinished doses can lead to development of drug resistance in the bacteria."
Strabismus,"What is strabismus?
Strabismus — also known as hypertropia and crossed eyes — is misalignment of the eyes, causing one eye to deviate inward (esotropia) toward the nose, or outward (exotropia), while the other eye remains focused. Misalignment can occur once in a while in newborns, especially if they are tired, but they should outgrow it by three months of age. In children, uncorrected strabismus can lead to amblyopia, a condition in which the brain starts to ignore signals sent by the weaker, misaligned eye that leads to vision problems.
In some children, strabismus is one of several manifestations of other medical conditions, including traumatic brain injury, retinopathy of prematurity, retinoblastoma, cerebral palsy and others.
Symptoms
Crossed eyes
Uncoordinated eye movements
Double vision
Vision in only one eye, with loss of depth perception
Diagnosis
If your doctor determines that your child has strabismus, the following tests will help determine the degree of the problem and possible causes:
Visual acuity
Retinal exam
Neurological examination
Treatment
It is important to start treatment as early as possible to prevent vision problems and vision loss.
Strengthening the eye muscles to realign the eyes by use of glasses and eye muscle exercises
In cases of amblyopia, covering the strong eye with a patch to stimulate the weaker eye
Surgery to realign the muscles
The patch is not a popular treatment with children, who find it annoying and distressful. Johns Hopkins Children’s Center ophthalmologists have been using less traumatic treatments, such as drops or special glasses, simply to temporarily blur vision in the good eye, thus stimulating the weaker eye.
If surgery is necessary, Hopkins Children’s Center eye surgeons can use a technique called adjustable sutures. In this procedure, the surgeon precisely aligns the eyes several hours after surgery. Some types of strabismus now can be treated with a new drug instead of surgery. The drug temporarily weakens muscles, and when injected into the stronger set of muscles, it eases the pull, allowing the weaker muscle to gain strength. The drug gradually wears off over a few months, and muscle balance and eye alignment are often restored.
When to Call for Help
Seek advice from a specialist if your child is older than three months and his or her eyes are misaligned, even if it only happens from time to time, or if you notice that the child often looks with one eye closed or turns his or her head to one side when looking at things."
Stroke in children,"What is pediatric stroke?
Pediatric stroke is a rare condition affecting one in every 4,000 newborns and an additional 2,000 older children each year. Stroke is a type of blood vessel (cerebrovascular) disorder. Strokes can be categorized as ischemic (caused by insufficient blood flow) and hemorrhagic (caused by bleeding into the brain). When a blood vessel in the brain is injured, the brain tissue around it loses blood supply and suffers injury as well. Treatments and long-term outcome in children are different for each type.
As with adults, without prompt and appropriate treatment, stroke in children can be life threatening and requires immediate medical attention. Stroke is among the top 10 causes of death in children. Pediatric stroke can also cause neurologic disability, with a risk of permanent long-term cognitive and motor impairment.
IF YOU SUSPECT YOUR CHILD IS HAVING A STROKE, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY.
What are the signs and symptoms of pediatric stroke?
Stroke in children typically begins suddenly. Symptoms may include (but are not limited to) the following:
weakness or numbness on one side of the body
slurred speech or difficulty with language
trouble balancing or walking
vision problems, such as double vision or loss of vision
sudden lethargy or drowsiness
seizure (unusual rhythmic movement of one or both sides of the body)
What are the risk factors for pediatric stroke?
Causes of stroke in children are different than those in adults. Risk factors include:
heart disease
problems with blood vessels supplying the brain
blood clotting disorders
sickle cell disease
Pediatric Stroke Diagnosis
When a child experiences symptoms that may indicate a stroke, rapid and thorough evaluation by a pediatrician or neurologist is essential to initiate treatment quickly and lower the risk of long-term problems.
Imaging studies of the brain and blood vessels, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT), are essential for diagnosis.
Additional testing to find the cause of the stroke may include:
catheter angiogram (a thin, flexible tube is inserted into blood vessels, contrast is injected, and X-rays are used to take pictures of the arteries and veins in the brain)
echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart)
blood tests for clotting disorders
Your child may need to see other specialists to help identify the cause of the stroke, including intensive care doctors, hematologists (specialists in blood disorders), neurologists, neurosurgeons, interventional radiologists and rehabilitation doctors (specialists in rehabilitation to recover function after stroke).
Pediatric Stroke Treatment
In the early stages of a stroke, your child’s treatment centers around supporting blood flow to the brain. Treatment may be a combination of the following:
Medical therapy: Your child may receive aspirin or other blood thinners (anticoagulants) and special vitamins. Children with sickle cell disease and stroke may be treated with hydroxyurea, transfusion therapy or both. If the stroke is causing seizures, your child may need anti-seizure medication as well.
“Clot-busting” medications used successfully in adults have not yet been approved for use in children, but they may be considered in certain situations.
Interventional neuroradiology: If your child has abnormal connections in blood vessels that feed the brain (arteriovenous malformation) or blood vessels with weakened walls that can bulge and tear (aneurysm), the doctor may place a catheter inside the affected blood vessel to help repair the abnormal area. In some situations, a catheter can be used to remove large clots in blood vessels to help restore essential blood flow to the brain. These interventional neuroradiology procedures are done with a catheter that is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and guided into the blood vessels in the brain.
Surgery: A surgical procedure may be appropriate for certain types of stroke and other cerebrovascular disorders. The type of surgery needed depends on the cause of the stroke. Surgery to remove a piece of bone (craniectomy) may be required in cases with severe brain swelling. Some other surgeries for stroke include closure of abnormal blood vessels, removal of abnormal areas of the brain and rerouting blood vessels to help provide blood supply to injured areas.
Pediatric Stroke Recovery
Follow-up care is extremely important. Once your child is stabilized, your medical team will work with you to create an ongoing plan to assess your child’s function and optimize recovery.
Depending on where in the brain the stroke occurred, your child may experience difficulties with walking, seeing, speaking or reading, sometimes with one side of the body affected more than the other. The stroke may cause a seizure disorder or have an impact on your child’s thinking or emotions.
Overall, a child’s growing brain has a better chance of recovering from stroke than an adult’s brain. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can minimize the risk of lasting problems, and early rehabilitation can help maximize recovery."
Sturge-Weber syndrome,"What is Sturge-Weber syndrome?
Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is the association of a facial port-wine birthmark with glaucoma, abnormal vessels on the surface of the brain or both. Some children or adults have an isolated intracranial variant, meaning abnormal brain blood vessels with no skin or eye symptoms. SWS does NOT generally run in families. It can affect one side of the body or brain (in about 85 percent of cases) or both sides (in about 15 percent of cases).
The presence of a port-wine birthmark involving the forehead or upper eyelid raises the suspicion of SWS. These infants and children must be followed closely for other medical issues, including vision problems, epilepsy and developmental delays. In addition to the port-wine stain, children with SWS may experience seizures, weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), developmental delays and increased pressure in the eye (glaucoma).
Treatment
Seizures occur in more than 80 percent of children diagnosed with SWS. Approximately 25 percent of those children achieve full seizure control with medication, 50 percent receive partial seizure control and 25 percent receive no seizure control from medication. In more severe cases, a hemispherectomy may be performed.
 "
Substance abuse/chemical dependence in adolescents,"What is substance use disorder?
Substance use disorder is the medical term used to describe a pattern of using a substance (drug) that causes significant problems or distress. This may be missing work or school, using the substance in dangerous situations, such as driving a car. It may lead to substance-related legal problems, or continued substance use that interferes with friendships, family relationships, or both. Substance use disorder, as a recognized medical brain disorder, refers to the use of illegal substances, such as marijuana, heroin, cocaine, or methamphetamine. Or the misuse of legal substances, such as alcohol, nicotine, or prescription medicines. Alcohol is the most common legal drug associated with substance use disorder.
Substance (drug) dependence
Substance dependence is the medical term used to describe use of drugs or alcohol that continues even when significant problems related to their use have developed. Signs of dependence include:
Tolerance to or need for increased amounts of the drug to get an effect
Withdrawal symptoms that happen if you decrease or stop using the drug that you find difficult to cut down or quit
Spending a lot of time to get, use, and recover from the effects of using drugs
Withdrawal from social and recreational activities
Continued use of the drug even though you are aware of the physical, psychological, and family or social problems that are caused by your ongoing drug use
What substances are associated with substance use disorder?
Substances frequently include:
Alcohol
Marijuana
Prescription medicines, such as pain pills, stimulants, or anxiety pills
Methamphetamine
Cocaine
Opiates
Hallucinogens
Inhalants
What causes substance use disorder?
Cultural and societal factors determine what are acceptable or allowable forms of drug or alcohol use. Public laws determine what kind of drug use is legal or illegal. The question of what type of substance use can be considered normal or acceptable remains controversial. Substance use disorder is caused by multiple factors, including genetic vulnerability, environmental stressors, social pressures, individual personality characteristics, and psychiatric problems. But which of these factors has the biggest influence in any one person cannot be determined in all cases.
What are the symptoms of substance use disorder?
The following are the most common behaviors that mean a person is using or misusing drugs or alcohol. But each person may have slightly different symptoms. Symptoms may include:
Using or drinking larger amounts or over longer periods of time than planned.
Continually wanting or unsuccessfully trying to cut down or control use of drugs or alcohol.
Spending a lot of time getting, using, or recovering from use of drugs or alcohol.
Craving, or a strong desire to use drugs or alcohol.
Ongoing drug or alcohol use that interferes with work, school, or home duties.
Using drugs or alcohol even with continued relationship problems caused by use.
Giving up or reducing activities because of drug or alcohol use
Taking risks, such as sexual risks or driving under the influence.
Continually using drugs or alcohol even though it is causing or adding to physical or psychological problems.
Developing tolerance or the need to use more drugs or alcohol to get the same effect. Or using the same amount of drugs or alcohol, but without the same effect.
Having withdrawal symptoms if not using drugs or alcohol. Or using alcohol or another drug to avoid such symptoms.
The symptoms of substance use disorder may resemble other medical problems or psychiatric conditions. Always consult your doctor for a diagnosis.
How is substance use disorder diagnosed?
A family doctor, psychiatrist, or qualified mental health professional usually diagnoses substance use disorder. Clinical findings often depend on the substance, the frequency of use, and the length of time since last used, and may include:
Weight loss
Constant fatigue
Red eyes
Little concern for hygiene
Lab abnormalities
Unexpected abnormalities in heart rate or blood pressure
Depression, anxiety, or sleep problems
Treatment for substance use disorder
Specific treatment for substance use disorder will be determined by your doctor based on:
Your age, overall health, and health history
Extent of the symptoms
Extent of the dependence 
Type of substance you are using
Your tolerance for specific medicines, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the condition
Your opinion or preference
A variety of treatment (or recovery) programs for substance use disorder are available on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Programs considered are usually based on the type of substance. Detoxification (if needed, based on the substance) and long-term follow-up management or recovery-oriented systems of care are important features of successful treatment. Long-term follow-up management usually includes formalized group meetings and psychosocial support systems, as well as continued medical supervision. Individual and family psychotherapy are often recommended to address the issues that may have contributed to and resulted from the development of a substance use disorder."
Synovitis,"What is synovitis?
Synovitis is a type of arthritis that causes hip pain and limping. It occurs in children prior to the onset of puberty and usually resolves on its own.
Symptoms
Hip pain (one side only)
Limp
Thigh pain, in front and toward the middle
Knee pain
Low-grade fever
Diagnosis
Toxic/transient synovitis is diagnosed only after more serious conditions have been ruled out. Exams can include an ultrasound or X-ray of the hip, a complete blood count and in some cases, a bone scan and aspiration of hip joint fluid.
Treatment
Children can limit activity to ease pain or soreness but may engage in normal activities as they like. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications may be prescribed to reduce pain. Generally the hip pain goes away in seven to 10 days. For persistent or more severe cases, your doctor may recommend a hip arthroscopy to remove the inflamed tissue. 
 "
Systemic sclerosis,"Scleroderma is a group of diseases with a common symptom: hardening and tightening of the skin. There are two types of scleroderma: localized and systemic. Localized scleroderma only affects the skin and systemic scleroderma affects the skin, the blood vessels and internal organs.
Scleroderma is a rheumatic disease, which means patients may have inflammation, pain, swelling and stiffness in the joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, muscles and/or tissues. It’s also an autoimmune disease.
Scleroderma affects many more women than men, and it’s typically found in people between the ages of 30 and 50. As many as 300,000 people in the United States have been diagnosed with scleroderma, and as many as 10,000 die each year from the most serious forms of the disease.

Tenosynovitis,"What is tenosynovitis?
Tenosynovitis describes inflammation of the lining of the protective sheath (the synovium) that covers the tendon.
Symptoms
Difficulty moving a joint
Joint pain and tenderness, especially the hand, wrist, foot and ankle
Joint swelling
Diagnosis
Diagnosis includes a physical exam that reveals swelling over the involved tendon and related muscle pain.
Treatment
Treatment is designed to relieve the pain and reduce the inflammation. Rest or immobilization of the affected tendons is critical to recovery. Applied heat or cold can help, as can nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications like ibuprofen. If the tenosynovitis is caused by an infection, antibiotics will be prescribed. A full recovery from tenosynovitis is likely with appropriate care and treatment."
Tetralogy of fallot,"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is a combination of four congenital (present at birth) heart defects that affect infants and children. The defects occur together and change the way blood flows through the heart and lungs. TOF occurs in about 1 out of every 2,518 babies born in the U.S. each year.
Pediatric cardiologist Rukmalee Vithana of the Blalock-Taussig-Thomas Pediatric and Congenital Heart Center explains what you should know about TOF.
What is tetralogy of Fallot?
In a healthy heart, blood travels through the heart to the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Then oxygen-rich blood leaves the lungs, travels back to the heart, and then courses throughout the body. Infants with TOF have trouble getting enough blood to their lungs, so the body gets too much oxygen-poor blood.
The four heart defects of tetralogy of Fallot include:
Pulmonary stenosis: A narrowed or stiffened pulmonary valve means the pulmonary artery has trouble sending enough blood from the heart to the lungs.
Ventricular septal defect (VSD): VSD is a hole between the two lower chambers (ventricles) of the heart. The hole allows oxygen-rich blood and oxygen-poor blood to mix, so the body does not receive enough oxygen-rich blood.
Overriding aorta: The aorta, which is the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body, is out of place and rises above both ventricles. As a result, the body gets too much oxygen-poor blood.
Hypertrophy (enlargement) of the right ventricle: The right lower chamber of the heart is bigger or thicker than normal, making it harder for blood to go through the pulmonary valve."
Thalassemias,"Thalassemias are inherited disorders characterized by abnormal production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. They result in low hemoglobin production and destruction of red blood cells. These diseases usually occur only in people who have at least two abnormal genes. Carriers (people with only one abnormal gene) usually do not have any problems, unless they carry other abnormal genes that interact with the thalassemia gene.
Listed in the directory below, you will find additional information regarding two different types of thalassemia, for which we have provided a brief overview.
Symptoms
Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Jaundice
Bone deformities in the face
Diagnosis
Enlarged spleen
Peripheral blood smear shows small, abnormally shaped red blood cells
Complete blood count shows anemia
Hemoglobin electrophoresis shows abnormal hemoglobin
Treatment
Regular blood transfusions and folate supplements are treatments for severe thalassemia. Medications are needed to remove excess iron in patients receiving transfusions frequently.

Toe walking,"WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW
Some children walk on their toes rather than their feet. This looks similar to standing on your “tiptoes.”
Toe walking is common among infants first learning to walk.
A majority of children will stop toe walking on their own without intervention.
Physical therapy, bracing and casting are used to treat toe walking, with surgical procedures available if these methods are unsuccessful."
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS),"What is toxic shock syndrome?
Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a cluster of symptoms that involves many systems of the body. Certain bacterial infections release toxins into the bloodstream, which then spreads the toxins to body organs. This can cause severe damage and illness.
What causes toxic shock syndrome?
The following bacteria commonly cause TSS:
Staphylococcus aureus
Streptococcus pyogenes
Clostridium sordellii
TSS from Staphylococcus infections was identified in the late 1970s and early 1980s when highly absorbent tampons were widely used by menstruating women. Due to changes in how tampons are made, the incidence of tampon-induced TSS has declined.
TSS from streptococcus infections is most commonly seen in children and the elderly. Other people at risk include those with diabetes, weak immune system, chronic lung disease, or heart disease.
Staphylococcus infections. Staphylococcus aureus (or S. aureus) may normally exist on a person's body and does not cause infection. Because it's part of the body's normal bacteria, most people develop antibodies to prevent infection. S. aureus can be spread by direct contact with infected persons. People who develop TSS usually have not developed antibodies against S. aureus. Therefore, it's not usually considered a contagious infection. S. aureus infections may also develop from another infection, such as pneumonia, sinusitis, osteomyelitis (infection in the bone), or skin wounds, such as a burn or surgical site. If any of these areas are infected, the bacteria can penetrate into the bloodstream.
Streptococcus infections. Streptococcus pyogenes (or S. pyogenes) TSS may occur as a secondary infection. Most commonly, this is seen in people who have recently had chickenpox, bacterial cellulitis (infection of the skin and underlying tissue), or who have weak immune systems.
Clostridium sordellii infections. Clostridium sordellii (or C. sordellii) normally exists in the vagina and does not cause infection. The bacteria may enter the uterus during normal menstruation, childbirth, or gynecological procedures such as abortion. Intravenous drug use can also cause C. sordellii infections.
Who is at risk for toxic shock syndrome?
The following are risk factors for toxic syndrome:
History of using super-absorbent tampons
Surgical wounds
A local infection in the skin or deep tissue
History of using the diaphragm or contraceptive sponge
History of recent childbirth, miscarriage, or abortion
What are the symptoms of toxic shock syndrome?
Symptoms of TSS involve many systems and may look like other infections. While each person may experience symptoms differently, the following are the most common symptoms of staphylococcal TSS:
Fever higher than 102°F (38.9°C)
Chills
Feeling unwell
Headache
Fatigue
Rash that is red and flat and that covers most of the areas of the body
Shedding of the skin in large sheets, especially over the palms and soles, seen one to two weeks after the onset of symptoms.
Low blood pressure
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Muscle pain
Increased blood flow to the mouth, eyes, and vagina, making them appear red
Decreased urine output and sediment in urine
Decreased liver function
Bruising due to low blood platelet count
Disorientation and confusion
The following are the most common symptoms of streptococcal TSS:
Dangerously low blood pressure
Shock
Decreased kidney function
Bleeding problems
Bruising due to low blood platelet count
Rash that is red and flat and that covers most of the areas of the body
Liver impairment
Shedding of the skin in large sheets, especially over the palms and soles (this does not always occur)
Difficulty breathing
The following are the most common symptoms of C. sordellii TSS:
Nausea and/or vomiting
Lethargy
Flu-like symptoms
Abdominal tenderness
Generalized swelling from fluid buildup
High white blood cell and red blood cell count
No fever
Low blood pressure
Very fast heart rate
How is toxic shock syndrome diagnosed?
Ruling out similar illnesses (such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, among others) is critical in diagnosing TSS. Other diagnostic tests may include:
Blood cultures. Tests used to find and identify microorganisms.
Blood tests. Tests to measure blood clotting and bleeding times, cell counts, electrolytes, and liver function, among others.
Urine tests.
Lumbar puncture. A procedure involving the insertion of a needle in between the vertebrae of the spine to draw spinal fluid and check for bacteria.
How is toxic shock syndrome treated?
Specific treatment will be determined by your health care provider based on:
Your age, health, and medical history
Extent of the disease
Your tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies
Expectations for the course of the disease
Your opinion or preference
Treatment for TSS may include:
Giving intravenous (through a vein) antibiotics
Giving intravenous fluid to treat shock and prevent organ damage
Heart medications in people with very low blood pressure
Dialysis may be required in people who develop kidney failure
Giving blood products
Supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation to assist with breathing
Deep surgical cleaning of an infected wound
What are the complications of toxic shock syndrome?
TSS can result in amputations of fingers, toes, or limbs, or even death.
Can toxic shock syndrome be prevented?
Since reinfection is common, menstruating girls and women should avoid using tampons if they have had TSS.
Prompt and thorough wound care is crucial in avoiding TSS.
Minimal usage of vaginal foreign body items, such as diaphragms, tampons, and sponges can also help prevent TSS.
When should I call my health care provider?
TSS may start like other infections, but it can quickly progress to a seriously life-threatening disease. If a mild illness quickly becomes severe with whole-body symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.
Key Points about Toxic Shock Syndrome
Toxic shock syndrome describes a cluster of symptoms that involve many systems of the body.
It can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Clostridium sordellii.
Early symptoms are similar to other infections but can progress quickly to become life-threatening.
TSS can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.
Next Steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your health care provider:
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
Bring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.
At the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you.
If you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your provider if you have questions."
Tracheomalacia,"What is tracheomalacia?
Tracheomalacia in a newborn occurs when the cartilage in the windpipe, or trachea, has not developed properly. Instead of being rigid, the walls of the trachea are floppy, resulting in breathing difficulties soon after birth. Babies born with tracheomalacia may have other congenital abnormalities, such as heart defects, developmental delays and gastroesophageal reflux. Also, aspiration pneumonia can occur from inhaling food.
Symptoms
Breathing noises that may change with position and improve during sleep
Breathing problems that get worse with coughing, crying, feeding or upper respiratory infections
High-pitched or rattling breathing
Diagnosis
A physical examination confirms the symptoms. A chest X-ray may show narrowing of the trachea when breathing in. A procedure called a laryngoscopy, which allows the otolaryngologist to see the airway structure, provides a definitive diagnosis. Other tests may include:
Airway fluoroscopy
Barium swallow
Bronchoscopy (a camera down the throat to see the airways and lungs)
CT scan
Lung function tests
MRI
Treatment
Most infants respond well to humidified air, careful feedings and antibiotics for infections. Babies with tracheomalacia must be closely monitored when they have respiratory infections. Often, the symptoms of tracheomalacia improve as the infant grows. Rarely, surgery is needed.
Prognosis
Congenital tracheomalacia generally goes away on its own between 18 and 24 months. As the tracheal cartilage gets stronger and the trachea grows, the noisy respirations and breathing difficulties gradually stop."
Transient tachypnea of the newborn,"What is transient tachypnea of the newborn?
Transient tachypnea of the newborn, or TTN, is a respiratory disorder usually seen shortly after delivery in babies who are born near or at term. Transient means it is short lived (usually less than 24 hours) and tachypnea means rapid breathing.
Symptoms
Newborns with TTN have respiratory problems soon after birth (within one to two hours). These usually consist of some combination of rapid, noisy breathing (grunting) and/or the use of extra muscles to breathe (flaring nostrils or movements between the ribs or breastbone known as retractions).
Diagnosis
The mother’s pregnancy and labor history are important to make the diagnosis. A chest X-ray may be taken to eliminate other causes of respiratory problems. A blood count and blood culture may be drawn to try to rule out infection. TTN is usually diagnosed after monitoring your baby for one to two days.
Treatment
Your baby will be given oxygen as needed to maintain an adequate blood oxygen level. Pulse oximeter and/or blood gases may be used. Your baby’s oxygen requirement will usually be highest within a few hours after birth and then begin to decrease. Most infants with TTN improve in 12 to 24 hours.
If your baby is breathing very rapidly, feedings may be withheld and intravenous fluids may be given for nutrition until he or she improves. Your baby may also receive antibiotics during this time until infection is ruled out. Rarely, babies with TTN may have persistent lung problems for as long as one week.
Prognosis
TTN usually resolves completely within 24 hours after delivery. Babies who have had TTN usually have no further problems from it and require no special care or follow-up other than their routine pediatrician visits."
Tricuspid atresia,"What is tricuspid atresia?
Tricuspid atresia (TA) is a heart defect present at birth (congenital). It occurs when the tricuspid valve doesn't form right during fetal heart development. This happens during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. The tricuspid valve is located between the right upper chamber (atrium) and the right lower chamber (ventricle) of the heart. The defect keeps blood from flowing normally from the right atrium to the right ventricle.
In tricuspid atresia, the following occurs:
The tricuspid valve does not form properly or at all.
The right ventricle is often smaller than normal.
There is an opening between the 2 atria (atrial septal defect). This is usually an open (patent) foramen ovale. The foramen ovale is a normal part of fetal circulation. It usually closes shortly after birth.
There is an opening between the ventricles (ventricular septal defect).
An open (patent) ductus arteriosus allows blood to flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery which allows blood to flow to the lungs for oxygen. The ductus arteriosus is a normal part of fetal circulation. It usually closes shortly after birth.
Other heart defects may also be present (such as transposition of the great vessels, pulmonary stenosis, or pulmonary atresia)
What causes tricuspid atresia?
The fetal heart develops during the first 8 weeks of pregnancy. In tricuspid atresia, the tricuspid valve does not form as it should. Development of the ventricles is influenced by blood flowing through them. Since blood does not pass through the tricuspid valve, the right ventricle remains small.
Some congenital heart defects may be passed down through families (genetic defects). Most of the time, there is no known cause for tricuspid atresia.
What are the symptoms of tricuspid atresia?
Symptoms of tricuspid atresia occur shortly after birth. Common symptoms may include:
Blue color of the skin, lips, and nail beds (cyanosis)
Fast breathing
Trouble breathing
Fast heart rate
Poor feeding
The symptoms of tricuspid atresia may look like other health conditions. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is tricuspid atresia diagnosed?
Tricuspid atresia may be diagnosed with a prenatal ultrasound exam. Otherwise, symptoms occur shortly after birth. A pediatric cardiologist or a neonatologist will help care for your child. These are doctors with special training to treat problems in children.
One or more healthcare providers will examine your baby. They will listen to your baby's heart and lungs with a stethoscope and note any abnormal heart sound (heart murmur).
Testing for congenital heart disease may include:
Pulse oximetry. A simple test that uses a small probe to check the amount of oxygen in the blood.
Lab tests. Blood and urine samples will be checked.
Chest X-ray. A chest X-ray may show changes often seen with tricuspid atresia.
Electrocardiogram (ECG). An ECG records the electrical activity of the heart. It shows abnormal rhythms, and detects heart muscle stress.
Echocardiogram (echo). An echo uses sound waves to make a moving picture of the heart and heart valves. The diagnosis of tricuspid atresia will be made based on finding the abnormal heart structures.
Cardiac catheterization (cardiac or heart cath). A cardiac catheterization gives very detailed information about the structures inside the heart. Your baby will be given medicine to relax (sedation). Then a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is put into a blood vessel in your baby's groin. It's guided to the heart. Blood pressure and oxygen measurements are taken in the heart chambers, the pulmonary artery, and the aorta. Contrast dye is also injected to more clearly see the structures inside the heart. A heart cath may also be used in the initial treatment of the defect.
How is tricuspid atresia treated?
Your child will most likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early medical treatment may include:
Supplemental oxygen or possibly a ventilator, to help with breathing.
IV medicines. Prostaglandin E1 may be given to keep the ductus arteriosus open. Other medicines may be given to help the heart and lungs work better.
Other early treatment may include:
Cardiac cath. In some cases, cardiac catheterization may be used in the early period. If pulmonary stenosis is present, a catheter with a balloon at the tip can be inflated to widen the valve and let enough blood flow through. This may allow the child to only need 2 surgical stages, rather than 3.
Balloon atrial septostomy. A special catheter with a balloon in the tip is used to create or enlarge an opening in the wall between the left and right atria (atrial septum). This helps with the flow of blood from the right side of the heart to the left side of the heart.
Three surgeries, in stages, may be done. They are:
Blalock-Taussig shunt. This surgery is done on newborns. It varies, depending on the exact defect present in your child. A connection (shunt) is created to allow blood from the aorta to reach the lungs and pick up oxygen.
Glenn shunt. This surgery may be done on babies from age 3 to 6 months. A new connection (shunt) replaces the first shunt. This shunt connects the large blood vessel from the top of the body to the heart (superior vena cava) to the pulmonary artery. This allows blood to get to the lungs for oxygen.
Fontan procedure. This surgery may be done from age 2 to 3 years. A second connection (shunt) is made. It allows blood from the large blood vessel from the lower part of the body to the heart to flow to the pulmonary artery. This surgery varies depending on the exact defect, as well as other factors.
Heart transplant is also a choice, but it is not usually done because it is difficult to find a donor heart. Also the surgeries to improve blood flow have become more and more successful.
What are the complications of tricuspid atresia?
Complications of tricuspid atresia may include:
Enlarged right atrium
Abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
Decreased ability to exercise
Heart failure
Decreased ability to absorb protein from intestines
Living with tricuspid atresia
Your child may need a series of repair procedures.
Before your child comes home, the nursing staff will explain medicines and treatments. For example, your child may need special formula and supplemental feedings to help him or her grow. The staff will also help to arrange home health care, if needed. You may get other instructions from your child's heart care team and the hospital staff.
Babies will have bluish skin (cyanosis) after the first 2 surgeries, or until the final Fontan procedure is done. Your child may grow and develop slowly because of decreased oxygen in the blood. After the Fontan procedure, when oxygen levels improve, you will likely see large improvements in your child's grow and development.
Your child will need to be followed by a pediatric cardiologist. The cardiologist may recommend:
Your child should get all recommended vaccines.
Your child will probably need antibiotics before some types of surgery or dental procedures.
Your child may have to avoid some sports.
As your child grows and matures, he or she will need to work with a cardiologist and other healthcare providers to plan pregnancy or surgeries.
Regular follow-up care at a center offering pediatric or adult congenital cardiac care should continue throughout life.
Talk with your child's cardiologist about the specific outlook for your child.
When should I call my child's healthcare provider?
Call your child's healthcare provider if your child's normal symptoms become worse or if new symptoms appear.
Key points about tricuspid atresia
Tricuspid atresia occurs when the tricuspid valve does not develop properly. This prevents blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle.
Tricuspid atresia may be identified during a prenatal ultrasound or shortly after birth when the baby becomes blue (cyanotic).
Your child will stay in the intensive care unit (ICU).
Your child will need medicines and a series of surgical procedures to allow oxygen-rich (red) blood to be pumped to the body.
Your child will need to be followed by a specialist in congenital heart conditions throughout life.
Next steps
Tips to help you get the most from a visit to your child's healthcare provider:
Know the reason for the visit and what you want to happen.
Before your visit, write down questions you want answered.
At the visit, write down the name of a new diagnosis, and any new medicines, treatments, or tests. Also write down any new instructions your provider gives you for your child.
Know why a new medicine or treatment is prescribed and how it will help your child. Also know what the side effects are.
Ask if your child's condition can be treated in other ways.
Know why a test or procedure is recommended and what the results could mean.
Know what to expect if your child does not take the medicine or have the test or procedure.
If your child has a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.
Know how you can contact your child's provider after office hours. This is important if your child becomes ill and you have questions or need advice."
Truncus arteriosus,"Truncus arteriosus, also known as TA, is a congenital (present at birth) heart defect. It occurs when there is one main blood vessel leaving the heart instead of two, which means that the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood is combined. Babies with TA need surgery to repair the defect. TA can be fatal if it is not treated.

TA is very rare. It affects about 1 out of every 10,000 live births in the U.S.
What is truncus arteriosus?
TA occurs when the two main blood vessels arising from the heart — the aorta and the pulmonary artery — do not separate as they should during fetal development. Babies with TA are born with one large vessel, or “trunk,” exiting the heart instead of two separate ones.
In most cases, TA occurs with another congenital heart defect called ventricular septal defect (VSD). VSD is a hole in the wall between the heart’s two lower chambers.
Other conditions that might occur with TA include:
Aortic arch abnormalities, such as coarctation and interrupted aortic arch
Patent ductus arteriosus
Pulmonary stenosis
Truncus arteriosus types
There are four types of truncus arteriosus. All types include a single trunk vessel exiting the heart. The difference is how and where the right and left pulmonary arteries split off to bring blood to each lung. The type will affect how repair is done.

The four types are:
Truncus arteriosus type 1: The most common form, occurring in about 60% of cases. The right and left pulmonary arteries branch off the main pulmonary artery once it separates from the common trunk.
Truncus arteriosus type 2: The right and left pulmonary arteries branch off directly from the common trunk.
Truncus arteriosus type 3: One pulmonary artery branches off the common trunk, and the other branches off the aorta.
Truncus arteriosus type 4: Neither pulmonary artery branches off the main artery. Instead, they branch off the descending aorta (portion of the aorta that moves downward into the chest).
How does truncus arteriosus affect blood flow?
After babies are born and begin using their lungs, blood prefers to flow into the lungs rather than out to the body. TA causes too much blood to flow into a baby’s lungs, which makes the heart work harder to pump blood to the rest of the body. The blood that does get to the body does not have as much oxygen as it should because the circulation is mixed.
Truncus Arteriosus Symptoms
Truncus Arteriosus symptoms in infants may include:
Breathing problems
Cyanosis (bluish skin, lips and nails from not getting enough oxygen-rich blood)
Difficulty feeding
Fatigue or extreme sleepiness
Heart murmur (abnormal sounds in the heart)
Poor weight gain
Pounding heart
Weak pulse 
Truncus Arteriosus Causes
TA might be the result of changes to certain genes or chromosomes. About 20% of babies with DiGeorge syndrome (a chromosomal disorder) also have TA. But in the majority of cases, TA occurs without any known cause.

Some risk factors increase the risk of congenital heart diseases such as TA:
Family history of congenital heart disease
Having certain medical conditions during pregnancy, such as rubella
Smoking or drinking alcohol during pregnancy
Taking certain medications during pregnancy
Truncus Arteriosus Diagnosis
A doctor may diagnose TA before birth with a prenatal ultrasound. If clinicians notice symptoms of TA after birth, they may perform the following tests:
Cardiac catheterization
Chest X-ray
Echocardiogram (echo)
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Pulse oximetry"
Tuberculosis,"Tuberculosis (TB)
What is TB?
Tuberculosis, or TB, is a bacterial infection that usually infects the lungs. Other organs, such as the kidneys, spine, or brain may also be involved. TB is primarily spread from person to person in an airborne manner, such as when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It can also cause an active infection after a period of not being active in someone who was exposed at an earlier time.
There is a difference between being infected with the TB bacterium and having active tuberculosis disease.
The following are the stages of TB:
Exposure. This happens when a person has been in contact with, or exposed to, another person who has TB. The exposed person will have a negative skin test, a normal chest X-ray, and no signs or symptoms of the disease.
Latent TB infection. This happens when a person has TB bacteria in his or her body, but does not have symptoms of the disease. The infected person's immune system walls off the TB organisms, and the TB remains inactive throughout life in most people who are infected. This person would have a positive skin test, but a normal chest X-ray.
TB disease. This describes the person who has signs and symptoms of an active infection. The person would have a positive skin test and a positive chest X-ray.
What causes TB?
The main TB bacterium is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Many people infected with this bacterium never develop active TB. They remain in the latent (inactive) TB stage. However, in people with weak immune systems, especially those with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), or those receiving medicines that suppress the immune system, TB organisms can overcome the body's defenses, multiply, and cause an active disease.
The TB bacterium is spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, speaks, sings, or laughs. It’s not likely to be spread through personal items, such as clothing, bedding, a drinking glass, eating utensils, a handshake, a toilet, or other items that a person with TB has touched. Good ventilation is the most important measure to prevent the transmission of TB.
Who is at risk for TB?
TB affects people of all ages, races and income levels. Those at higher risk include the following:
People who live or work with others who have TB
Those who can’t access health care
Homeless people
People from other countries where TB is prevalent
People in group settings, such as nursing homes
People who abuse alcohol
People who use intravenous drugs
People with weak immune systems
The elderly
Healthcare workers who come in contact with high-risk populations
What are the symptoms of TB?
The following are the most common symptoms of active TB. However, each person may experience symptoms differently:
Cough that lasts 3 weeks or longer
Chest pain
Fatigue
Loss of appetite
Unintended weight loss
Poor growth in children
Fever
Coughing blood or sputum
Chills or night sweats
The symptoms of TB may look like other lung conditions or medical problems. Talk with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is TB diagnosed?
TB is often diagnosed with a skin test. In this test, a small amount of testing material is injected into the top layer of the skin. If a certain size bump develops within 2 or 3 days, the test may be positive for tuberculosis infection. Other tests include X-rays and sputum tests. A blood test can be done in place of the TB skin test.
TB skin tests are suggested for those:
In high-risk categories
Who live or work in close contact with people who are at high risk
Who have never had a TB skin test
For skin testing in children, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends testing:
If the child is thought to have been exposed in the last 5 years
If the child has an X-ray that looks like TB
If the child has any symptoms of TB
If the child comes from a country where TB is prevalent
For children with HIV
For children receiving medicines that suppress the immune system
For children who are in detention facilities
For children who are exposed to high-risk people
If the child's parent has come from a high-risk country
If the child has traveled to high-risk areas
If the child lives in a densely populated area
How is TB treated?
Your healthcare provider will figure out the best treatment for you based on:
How old you are
Your overall health and past health
How sick you are
How well you can handle specific medicines, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Treatment may include:
Short-term hospitalization
For latent TB which is newly diagnosed: Usually a 6 to 12 month course of antibiotic called isoniazid will be given to kill off the TB organisms in the body. Some people with latent TB may be treated with a shorter course of 2 antibiotics for only 3 months.
For active TB: Your healthcare provider may prescribe 3 or more antibiotics in combination for 6 to 9 months or longer. Examples include: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. People usually begin to improve within a few weeks of the start of treatment. After several weeks of treatment with the correct medicines, the person is usually no longer contagious, if treatment is carried through to the end, as prescribed by a healthcare provider.
What are the complications of TB?
If TB is not treated early or if treatment isn’t followed, permanent lung damage can result.
Can TB be prevented?
If you will be spending time with a person or people with active TB, wear a face mask and try not to stay in a small enclosed space with poor ventilation. People who work in situations where there is a high risk for encountering people infected with TB, such as healthcare workers, should be tested for TB on a routine basis. In countries outside the U.S. where TB is more common, a childhood vaccine is often given.

When should I call my healthcare provider?
If your symptoms get worse or you get new symptoms, let your healthcare provider know.
Key points about TB
Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that usually infects the lungs.
It may also affect the kidneys, spine, and brain.
Being infected with the TB bacterium is not the same as having active tuberculosis disease.
There are 3 stages of TB—exposure, latent, and active disease.
A TB skin test or a TB blood test can diagnose the disease.
Treatment exactly as recommended is necessary to cure the disease and prevent its spread to other people.

Turner syndrome,"What is Turner syndrome?
Turner syndrome is one of several syndromes of abnormal sex differentiation. Most females have a pair of sex chromosomes designated as XX, and most males have a pair of sex chromosomes designated as XY. In Turner syndrome, which only affects females, there is a partially or completely missing X chromosome.
Symptoms
Children with Turner syndrome can be very different from one another, and symptoms vary greatly from child to child. Some common symptoms include:
Webbing of the neck
A broad chest
Low-set ears
Low hairline
Horseshoe-shaped kidneys that usually function normally
Cardiovascular problems, including structural problems and high blood pressure
Short stature and delayed growth
Abnormal puberty: Girls with Turner syndrome do not have ovaries but do have normal female external sex organs. However, because they lack ovaries (and thus the female sex hormone estrogen), girls with Turner do not develop breasts and do not have menstruation during puberty.
Type 2 diabetes
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)
Diagnosis
Turner syndrome can be diagnosed at any age. It can be detected before birth if prenatal testing is done. In early childhood, infants with Turner syndrome often have swollen hands and feet. The following tests may be performed: 
Blood hormone levels
Echocardiogram (heart ultrasound) 
Karyotype (chromosome analysis) 
MRI of the chest 
Ultrasound of reproductive organs and kidneys 
Pelvic exam 
Treatment 
There's no cure for Turner syndrome, but certain treatments can help cope with the symptoms and effects of this condition. Hormone treatments with growth hormone and/or other hormones can improve growth and help girls achieve taller heights in adulthood. Estrogen replacement around the age of 12 or 13 may be initiated to stimulate the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breasts, and menstruation. If structural heart defects are present, cardiac surgery may be needed.
 "
Undescended testicle,"What is an undescended testicle?
The testicles are formed inside the abdomen, and they gradually migrate down. In the last few weeks before the birth of the child, they pass through the abdominal wall muscles and groin to their normal position in the scrotum. Any testis that is not located in the scrotum is undescended. This condition is fairly common, occurring in 3 percent to 5 percent of full-term boys at birth, with a much higher incidence in premature infants. However, the majority of undescended testicles will descend to a normal position within the first three to six months of life. Approximately 0.8 percent to 1 percent of full-term boys will continue to have an undescended testis at a year of age, requiring treatment. There may be several reasons why a testicle is not in the scrotum:
The testicle may never have formed to begin with.
The testicle may have shrunken before birth because of a twist or blockage of its blood vessels.
The testicle may have not descended properly but remains within the abdominal cavity.
In the above conditions, the testicle will not be found on a physical examination, referred to as an impalpable testicle. The testicle may have descended incompletely and may be in the groin or between the abdominal muscles (inguinal canal), just above the scrotum.
Diagnosis
Undescended testicles are usually diagnosed by physical examination. The initial evaluation is done during the newborn period, followed by periodic examination during well-child visits. Treatment is recommended if the testicle is located in the groin and cannot be brought down into the scrotum (undescended testicle) or if it is not found either in the scrotum or in the groin (impalapable testicle) by the age of six months to a year.
While the impalpable testis may occasionally be identified on radiological tests such as an ultrasound, CT scan or MRI, none of these tests are conclusive enough to be recommended routinely in these situations.
The testicles need a slightly cooler environment than the normal body temperature for optimal functioning and especially for sperm production. Thus, if both testicles are left undescended, there may be a risk of infertility. Locations outside of the scrotum may expose the testicle to a higher risk of injury. Undescended testicles are also associated with hernias. In addition, undescended testicles are at a higher risk of developing testicular cancer in adulthood. Testicular cancer, if identified and treated early, has a high cure rate. Early identification is only possible if the testicle is located in the scrotum; therefore, this is an important reason to treat undescended testicles.
Treatment
Recent evidence suggests that most spontaneous descent occurs by six months of age. Damage to the germ cells, which give rise to sperm later in life, has been noted to occur as early as 12 to 18 months. For these reasons, we recommend treatment around the age of 9 to 12 months. Two main avenues of treatment are available — hormone injections and surgery. Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) has been used, but reported success rates are low and unpredictable. Surgical treatment, or orchiopexy, is usually done as an outpatient through a small incision in the groin. Any hernias associated can be corrected at the same time, and the testis is placed in a pouch created under the scrotal skin. 
With an impalpable testis, a laparoscopic examination is performed through a keyhole incision in the umbilicus to identify the presence and location of the testicle. If only a remnant is identified, it can be removed. On the other hand, if the testicle is a good size, it can be brought down into the scrotum after laparoscopic dissection of the blood vessels to obtain adequate length. Occasionally, this may require a two-stage operation if not enough length is initially obtained. Surgical treatment is usually an outpatient procedure (laparoscopic or open). All incisions are closed with absorbable sutures. The child may require prescription pain medicine for approximately 48 hours. Older children will need a week off from school and a total of three to four weeks away from playground and straddling activities.
If treated early, there is a good chance that the affected testicle will develop normally. In some cases, the testicle is abnormal to begin with and its growth may be affected. However, if the other testicle is normal fertility may not be an issue. The undescended testicle needs to monitored long-term, and these children should be taught testicular self examination to be performed monthly. If the testicle is absent or was removed due to poor development, a testicular prosthesis is an option. These are made of silicone and are available in different sizes. In order to avoid multiple operations to keep upsizing the prosthesis, we recommend waiting until puberty to determine the size required to match the remaining testis. In some teenagers affected psychologically by the loss of a testis, a testicular prosthesis may help improve their self-image."
Upper respiratory infection,"What is the common cold in children?
The common cold (upper respiratory infection) is one of the most common illnesses in children. Each year it leads to more healthcare provider visits and missed days from school and work than any other illness. Millions of people in the U.S. will get a cold each year.
Here are a few facts:
Most children will have at least 6 to 8 colds a year. Children who attend daycare will have more.
Colds may occur less often after age 6.
Children are more likely to have colds during fall and winter.
What causes the common cold in a child?
Colds happen when a virus irritates (inflames) the lining of the nose and throat. Colds can be caused by more than 200 different viruses. But most colds are caused by rhinoviruses.
To catch a cold, your child must come in contact with someone who is infected with one of the cold viruses. The cold virus can be spread:
Through the air. If a person with a cold sneezes or coughs, small amounts of the virus can go into the air. Then if your child breathes in that air, the virus will stick inside your child’s nose (nasal membrane).
By direct contact. This means that your child touches an infected person. A cold is easy for children to spread. That’s because they touch their nose, mouth, and eyes often and then touch other people or objects. This can spread the virus. It’s important to know that viruses can be spread through objects, such as toys, that have been touched by someone with a cold.
Which children are at risk for the common cold?
All children are at risk for the common cold. They are more likely than adults to get a cold. Here are some reasons why:
Less resistance. A child’s immune system is not as strong as an adult’s when it comes to fighting cold germs.
Winter season. Most respiratory illnesses happen in fall and winter, when children are indoors and around more germs. The humidity also drops during this season. This makes the passages in the nose drier and at greater risk for infection.
School or daycare. Colds spread easily when children are in close contact.
Hand-to-mouth contact. Children are likely to touch their eyes, nose, or mouth without washing their hands. This is the most common way germs are spread.
What are the symptoms of the common cold in a child?
Cold symptoms start from 1 to 3 days after your child has been in contact with the cold virus. Symptoms usually last about 1 week. But they may last up to 2 weeks. Symptoms may be a bit different for each child.
In babies, cold symptoms may include:
Trouble sleeping
Fussiness
Congestion in the nose
Sometimes vomiting and diarrhea
Fever
Older children may have:
Stuffy, runny nose
Scratchy, tickly throat
Watery eyes
Sneezing
Mild hacking cough
Congestion
Sore throat
Achy muscles and bones
Headaches
Low-grade fever
Chills
Watery discharge from the nose that thickens and turns yellow or green
Mild tiredness (fatigue)
These symptoms may seem like other health problems, such as the flu. Make sure your child sees his or her healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
How is the common cold diagnosed in a child?
Most common colds are diagnosed based on symptoms. But cold symptoms may seem like other bacterial infections, allergies, and health problems.
How is the common cold treated in a child?
There is no cure for the common cold. Most children recover from colds on their own. Antibiotics don’t work against viral infections, so they are not prescribed. Instead, treatment is focused on helping ease your child’s symptoms until the illness passes. To help your child feel better:
Give your child plenty of fluids, such as water, electrolyte solutions, apple juice, and warm soup. This helps prevent fluid loss (dehydration).
Make sure your child gets plenty of rest.
To ease nasal congestion, try saline nasal sprays. You can buy them without a prescription, and they're safe for children. These are not the same as nasal decongestant sprays. These may make symptoms worse.
Keep your child away from tobacco smoke. Smoke will make the irritation in the nose and throat worse.
Use children’s-strength medicine for symptoms. Discuss all over-the-counter (OTC) products with your child’s healthcare provider before using them. Don't give OTC cough and cold medicines to a child younger than 4 years old unless the provider tells you to do so. For children between the ages of 4 and 6 years, only use OTC products when recommended by your child's healthcare provider.
Never give aspirin to a child age 18 or younger who has a cold or flu. It could cause a rare but serious condition called Reye syndrome.
Never give ibuprofen to an infant age 6 months or younger.
Keep your child home until he or she has been fever-free for 24 hours.
Use a cool-mist humidifier in your child's room at night to make breathing easier."
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction,"The ureter is a long thin tubular structure 10-12 inches long which carries urine produced in the kidney to the bladder. The urine is transported by a process called peristalsis. The ureter actively propels urine from the kidney down into the bladder.
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction is a condition where blockage occurs at the junction where the ureter attaches to the kidney. This results in decreased flow of urine down the ureter and an increase of fluid pressure inside the kidney. Increased pressure inside the kidney can over time cause deterioration of kidney function. The obstruction can be either congenital (the patient is born with it) or develop over time secondary to trauma or change in body shape with age. The blockage can be due to scar tissue, kinking, a blood vessel or rarely tumor.
Signs and Symptoms
Ureteral obstruction can cause flank pain on the effected side. The pain may be intermittent and some patients notice increased pain when drinking alcohol, coffee or increased fluids. The pain can sometimes be in the front of the abdomen and can radiate down to the groin. In some instances, the condition is detected accidently on x-rays or ultrasound during evaluation for unrelated problems. When infection occurs in association with obstruction, patients can become quite ill and have high fevers. This condition may require hospitalization, emergency drainage of the urine and treatment with intravenous antibiotics.
Treatments
The traditional treatment for ureteropelvic junction obstruction has been open surgery to cut out the area of scarring and re-connect the ureter to the kidney. Over the past several years, newer less invasive treatment options have been developed.
Endopyelotomy is a procedure through which a telescope or balloon with an electric wire on it is passed to the level of the kidney. The scar tissue is then cut open from the inside. These procedures can be done in a short period of time as an outpatient with minimal anesthetic and with a much shorter recuperation than with open surgery. Patients will have to keep a temporary internal tube (stent) for four to six weeks. The radiographic success rate with these procedures are 15%-20% lower than what is obtained with open surgery. Moreover, 40% of patients may have significant persistent pain following procedure.
Laparoscopic Pyeloplasty was developed in order to give the same high success rate obtained with open pyeloplasty while decreasing the morbidity. The internal procedure is performed in the same manner as the open surgery without the need for a large incision. Postoperative pain is less, recuperation is significantly quicker and scarring is minimal when compared with open surgery. The procedure requires a general anesthetic and hospitalization (usually 2 nights). An internal stent is also needed for four weeks. Success with this procedure is the same as open surgery (>95%).
Ureteropelvic Junction Obstruction in Children
Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is a blockage in the area that connects the renal pelvis (part of the kidney) to one of the tubes (ureters) that move urine to the bladder. It generally occurs when a baby is still growing in the womb. This is called a congenital condition (present from birth).
  Most of the time, the blockage is caused when the connection between the ureter and the renal pelvis narrows. This causes urine to build up, damaging the kidney.
The condition can also be caused when a blood vessel is located in the wrong position over the ureter.
UPJ obstruction is the most frequently diagnosed cause of urinary obstruction in children. It is now commonly diagnosed during prenatal ultrasound studies. In some cases, the condition isn't seen until after birth.
Symptoms
There may not be any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include:
Back or flank pain
Bloody urine (hematuria)
Lump in the abdomen (abdominal mass)
Kidney infection
Poor growth in infants (failure to thrive)
Urinary tract infection, usually with fever
Vomiting
Diagnosis
An ultrasound during pregnancy may show kidney problems in the unborn baby. Tests after birth may include:
BUN
Creatinine clearance
CT scan
Electrolytes
IVP
Nuclear scan of kidneys
Voiding cystourethrogram
Treatment
Most cases of UPJ obstruction actually do not require surgery and resolve on their own. However, if patients exhibit pain, recurrent infections, evidence of worsening function or increasing swelling, they may require a surgery called a pyeloplasty to prevent kidney injury and correct the blockage. While this surgery was traditionally performed using an open incision underneath the ribcage, the standard of care in most children older than two years is to perform this surgery laparoscopically using a surgical robot. Robotic surgery can be performed through three small keyhole incisions in the abdomen and is associated with a shorter hospitalization, decreased pain following surgery, quicker recovery and return to normal activities, as well as improved scar appearance when compared with traditional open surgery — and has a 97 percent success rate."
Urinary tract infection (UTI),"Urinary tract infections or UTIs are infections in any part of the urinary tract. They are a common health problem that affects millions of people each year. Women are especially prone to UTIs.
A UTI may affect any part of the urinary tract causing:
Urethritis. This is an infection of the urethra, the hollow tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.
Cystitis. This is an infection in the bladder from germs that have moved up from the urethra.
Pyelonephritis. This infection of the kidneys is most often a result of an infection that has spread up the urinary tract, or from a blockage in the urinary tract. A blockage causes urine to back up into the ureters and kidneys.
Abscess. A collection of pus along the course of the urinary tract is called an abscess.
What causes urinary tract infections?
Normal urine is sterile and contains fluids, salts, and waste products. It does not contain bacteria, viruses, or fungi. A UTI occurs when germs, most often bacteria from the digestive tract, get into the opening of the urethra and start to multiply.
Most UTIs are caused by E. coli bacteria, which normally live in the colon.
What are the symptoms of a urinary tract infection?
These are the most common symptoms of a UTI:
Frequent urination
Pain or burning when passing urine
Fever
Urine looks dark, cloudy, or reddish in color (blood may be present in the urine)
Urine smells bad
Feeling pain even when not urinating
Tiredness
Pain in the back or side, below the ribs
Nausea and/or vomiting
Despite an strong urge to urinate, only a small amount of urine is passed
Women may feel an uncomfortable pressure above the pubic bone
The symptoms of UTI may look like other conditions or medical problems. Always see a health care provider for a diagnosis.
How are urinary tract infections diagnosed?
Your doctor will review your medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include:
Urinalysis. Lab testing of urine is done to check for various cells and chemicals, such as red and white blood cells, germs (like bacteria), or a lot of protein.
If UTIs become a repeated problem, other tests may be used to see if the urinary tract is normal. These tests may include:
Intravenous pyelogram (IVP). This is a series of X-rays of the kidney, ureters (the two tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder), and bladder. It uses a contrast dye injected into a vein. This can be used to find tumors, structural abnormalities, kidney stones, or blockages. It also checks blood flow in the kidneys.
Cystoscopy. In this test, a thin, flexible tube and viewing device is put in through the urethra to examine the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract. Structural changes or blockages, such as tumors or stones can be found.
Kidney and bladder ultrasound. This imaging test uses high-frequency sound waves to make images of the bladder and the kidneys on a computer screen. The test is used to determine the size and shape of the bladder and the kidneys, and check for a mass, kidney stone(s), cysts, or other blockages or abnormalities.
How are urinary tract infections treated?
Your health care provider will figure out the best treatment based on:
How old you are
Your overall health and medical history
How sick you are
How well you can handle specific medications, procedures, or therapies
How long the condition is expected to last
Your opinion or preference
Treatment for UTIs may include:
Antibiotics
Other medications to ease pain
Heat (such as heating pad) to ease pain
You may also need to make lifestyle changes such as:
Drinking plenty of water to help wash bacteria out of the urinary tract
Avoiding coffee, alcohol, and spicy foods
Quitting smoking
Can urinary tract infections be prevented?
These steps may help reduce the chance of getting UTIs:
Drink plenty of water every day.
Drink cranberry juice. Large amounts of vitamin C limit the growth of some bacteria by acidifying the urine. Vitamin C supplements have the same effect.
Urinate when you feel the need. Do not wait.
Females, wipe from front to back to keep bacteria around the anus from going in the vagina or urethra.
Take showers instead of tub baths.
Clean the genital area before and after sex, and urinate shortly after sex.
Women should not use feminine hygiene sprays or scented douches.
Cotton underwear and loose fitting clothes help keep the area around the urethra dry. Tight clothes and nylon underwear trap moisture. This can help bacteria grow.
Repeated bouts of urinary tract infections can be treated with small doses of regular antibiotics.
Please consult your health care provider with any questions or concerns you may have about UTIs.
Key points about urinary tract infections
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a common health problem that affects millions of people each year. These infections can affect any part of the urinary tract.

Urticaria,"What is urticaria?
Hives (urticaria) are a reaction that causes red, itchy, swollen welts on the skin. Typically, hives develop as an allergic reaction to food, drugs or other substances. Also, urticaria can occur during viral infections. Stress and sun exposure can be triggers as well. They come suddenly and go away just as suddenly.
Symptoms
Red itchy welts anywhere in the body that come and go suddenly are urticaria. In rare cases, hives are part of a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylaxis. Signs of anaphylaxis include:
Difficulty breathing
Confusion
Rapid heart beat
Swelling of the lips, tongue, throat
Wheezing
Slurred speech
Confusion
Bluish skin (cyanosis)
Light-headedness, dizziness, fainting
Hives and generalized itching
Anxiety
Heart palpitations
Nausea, vomiting
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain or cramping
Cough
Anaphylaxis is an emergency. Call 911 or go to the nearest emergency room if you suspect anaphylaxis.
Treatment
Avoiding any known causes and triggers of urticaria is the best way to prevent them. If the hives are caused by an allergy, antihistamines — medications that counter the immune system’s chemicals released against the allergen — may be given.
When to Call for Help
If your child develops the any of the above symptoms, call your pediatrician."
Vascular abnormalities,"The vascular system (network of blood vessels) in the brain of newborns, infants and growing children may be affected by rare disorders. Most of these conditions can be successfully treated. The most common of these problems include:
Aneurysms
Arteriovenous malformations
Moyamoya disease
Pediatric stroke
Symptoms of vascular abnormality can include:
Seizures as the first sign of trouble
Head growth out of proportion to the body
Acute onset of headaches
Stroke like symptoms
Diagnosis of a Vascular Abnormality
If a child develops a cerebrovascular condition (a condition relating to the blood vessels in the brain), a thorough evaluation by a pediatric neurosurgeon can diagnose the problem.
Your pediatric neurosurgeon is likely to conduct a thorough physical and will ask for a detailed family and patient history. Brain scans, including MRI scans plus MR angiography, or MRA, are likely to be part of your child’s work-up.
Treatment for a Vascular Abnormality
Sometimes in the case of a bleeding vessel in the brain, a pediatric interventional neuroradiologist can treat the problem by injecting various materials into the blood vessels to help stop the source of bleeding.
This treatment is called embolization, and sometimes it alone is enough to resolve the problem. Embolization also may stem the bleeding enough to make it easier for pediatric neurosurgeons to perform surgery so that the problem may be corrected.
Surgery Options
Brain Aneurysms
Your child’s pediatric neurosurgeon will determine the best course of surgical treatment, which may involve one of these procedures, depending on the location and size of the aneurysm:
Endovascular coiling (sealing the aneurysm from the rest of the circulatory system)
Open craniotomy and clipping (sealing and clipping the aneurysm)
Artery bypass and occlusion
Flow diversion with stents
AVM
The goal of surgery is to correct the vascular abnormality. Other forms of treatment are available, like embolization, discussed above, and radiosurgery treatments, which use focused X-rays to burn away the abnormalities.
The pediatric neurosurgeon will discuss the specific advantages and drawbacks to these treatments with you.
Moyamoya
Your pediatric neurosurgeon will rebuild the blood supply of the carotid artery, which is the main blood supply for the anterior brain.
After Surgery
Follow-up care is extremely important in tracking your child’s recovery. Your pediatric neurosurgeon will schedule follow-up appointments to make sure your child is making progress."
Vasculitis,"What is Behcet’s Syndrome?
Also called Behcet’s disease, Behcet’s syndrome is an inflammatory disease caused by damage to and inflammation of the blood vessels. Rare in the United States, it is common in the Middle East and Asia, affecting mainly those in their 20s and 30s.
What is vasculitis?
There are many types of vasculitis, including Behcet’s disease, large vessel vasculitis syndromes (such as Takayasu vasculitis), medium vessel vasculitis syndromes and small vessel vasculitis syndromes.
Symptoms
Sores in the mouth
Other skin sores
Swelling of parts of the eye
Pain, Swelling, stiffness in joints
Diagnosis
Medical evaluation.
Treatment
There is no cure but symptoms can be controlled with medication, rest and exercise. "
Vesicoureteral reflux,"What is vesicoureteral reflux?
Vesicoureteral reflux happens when urine dwelling in the bladder flows back into the ureters and often back into the kidneys. The bladder is the hollow, muscular organ that stores urine before urination happens. The bladder has 3 small openings; 2 connect the ureters where urine is drained down from the kidneys, and 1 connects the bladder to the urethra where urine exits the body.
The ureters are funnel-shaped tubes that carry urine from the kidneys. Ureters enter the bladder at a diagonal angle and have a special 1-way valve system that normally prevents urine from flowing back up the ureters in the direction of the kidneys. When a child has vesicoureteral reflux, the mechanism that prevents the backflow of urine does not work, allowing urine to flow in both directions. This condition is most frequently diagnosed in infancy and childhood. A child who has vesicoureteral reflux is at risk for developing recurrent kidney infections. This, over time, can cause damage and scarring to the kidneys.
What causes vesicoureteral reflux?
There are many different reasons why a child may develop vesicoureteral reflux. Some of the more common causes include:
Having parents or siblings with VUR
Being born with neural tube defects like spina bifida
Having other urinary tract abnormalities, like posterior urethral valves, ureterocele, or ureter duplication
During infancy, the disease is more common among boys because as they urinate there is more pressure in their entire urinary tract. In early childhood, the irregularity is more common in girls. VUR is more common in white children than in African-American children."
Vocal cord paralysis,"Vocal cord paralysis occurs when one or both of the vocal cords do not open or close properly. Symptoms can range from mild to life threatening. Vocal cord paralysis can be be present at birth (congenital) or can be caused by medical conditions or even by surgery in the neck and chest. Sometimes a cause cannot be identified.
Symptoms
Change in voice volume and pitch
Hoarseness
Difficulty swallowing
Coughing, especially after eating
Noisy breathing in some cases
Diagnosis
Physical exam
Laryngoscopy to examine the vocal cords and the surrounding tissues
Imaging of the neck, chest and brain in some cases
Treatment
It is important to treat the underlying disorder causing the paralysis. Generally, treatments include:
Surgery for persistent symptomatic vocal cord paralysis
Voice therapy and exercises to strengthen the vocal cords
Watchful waiting: In certain cases, the voice can return spontaneously within up to a year after onset of symptoms.
When to Call for Help
Call your pediatrician if your child has any of the symptoms listed above."
Vomiting,"What is vomiting?
Vomiting (also called emesis) is not a disease but a symptom. In children, a variety of conditions can cause vomiting, the most common of which is viral infection of the gastrointestinal tract, or gastroenteritis (also known as “stomach flu”). Bacterial infections and parasites in the gastrointestinal tract are other common causes of both vomiting and diarrhea in children. Because a child loses substantial amount of fluids with vomiting, especially if the vomiting lasts for more than 24 hours and is accompanied by diarrhea, it can lead to dehydration, which untreated can be life threatening. Regardless of the underlying cause, children suffering from vomiting should drink plenty of fluids to replenish water loss from the body.
A note of caution: Avoid giving plain water to an infant younger than 12 months. Formula and breast milk are the best sources of hydration in children under one year of age.Your pediatrician can advise you about other fluids that may be given to infants, how much to give and how often.
Less common causes of vomiting include head trauma or brain injury and brain tumors. Other conditions can lead to vomiting as well, including disorders of the liver, intestines, gallbladder and pancreas.
Symptoms
Vomiting
Nausea (may or may not be present)
Depending on the cause, vomiting may be accompanied by diarrhea, malaise and fever
Dehydration is a dangerous and common side effect of vomiting in children.
Watch for the following signs of dehydration:
Dry mouth
Few or no tears when crying
Fussiness and irritability in infants
Fewer than four wet diapers in 24 hours
Reduced frequency of urination and amount of urine at urination
Fatigue, drowsiness, excessive sleepiness
Disorientation, confusion
Deep, rapid breathing
Rapid heartbeat
Diagnosis
If a child’s vomiting doesn’t go away in a couple of days, a pediatrician should be contacted for diagnosis of the underlying cause leading to the vomiting. In addition to physical exam and blood tests, sometimes imaging studies (like ultrasound or X-rays) of the gastrointestinal tract may be needed.
Treatment 
Because vomiting is a symptom rather than a condition, treatment depends on the underlying cause. 
When to Call for Help
Call your pediatrician if your child has vomiting that doesn’t go away after 24 hours or starts again once a normal diet is resumed; if vomiting is accompanied by fever (temperature over 100.4 degrees in an infant or 101 degrees in a child over six months); if your child is vomiting blood or vomiting a substance that looks like coffee grounds; or if your child is vomiting yellowish or greenish fluid. Take your child to a hospital if your child vomits after hurting his or her head.
 "
Wilson's disease,"What is Wilson disease?
Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder passed from parents to children (inherited). It prevents your body from getting rid of extra copper in your system.
Your body needs small amounts of copper from food to stay healthy. But too much copper is toxic.
Normally, your liver gets rid of extra copper by sending it out in bile. Bile is the digestive juice your liver makes. It carries toxins and waste out of your body through your gastrointestinal tract.
When you have Wilson disease, your liver starts storing copper instead of getting rid of it. Over time, there is too much copper for your liver to store, and it can cause liver damage. The extra copper also can get into your bloodstream and collect in other organs as well as in your eyes and brain, and damage these structures. Over time, Wilson disease can be life-threatening.
What causes Wilson disease?
Wilson disease is caused by an inherited defect in the ATP7B gene. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means that both parents must pass on the same abnormal gene to the child. Many times parents, who have only one abnormal gene, show no signs of the disease but are carriers of the disease.
What are the symptoms of Wilson disease?
When you have Wilson disease, copper buildup starts at birth, but it can take years or even decades for symptoms to appear. Symptoms can start at any age but in most cases they start between ages 5 and 35.
The symptoms of Wilson disease vary depending on the organs that are affected.
Wilson disease may attack your brain and spinal cord (your central nervous system) and your liver. It may attack them at the same time. This can cause a group of symptoms that don’t seem to be related.
Liver symptoms
Liver symptoms may be those of long-lasting (chronic) liver disease such as:
Extreme tiredness (fatigue)
Muscle cramps
Weakness
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Vomiting
Weight loss
Fluid in your belly or legs
Yellowish skin or whites of eyes (jaundice)
Easy bruising
Swollen liver and spleen
Neurological symptoms
Copper buildup in the central nervous system can cause symptoms such as:
Changes in behavior
Stiff muscles
Tremors, shakes, or movements you can’t control
Slow or repeated movements
Weak muscles
Trouble swallowing
Slurred speech
Poor coordination
Drooling
Decreased fine motor abilities
Mental health symptoms
When copper builds up in the central nervous system, it can also cause psychological changes such as:
Feeling stressed and anxious
Being depressed
Losing touch with reality (psychosis)
Thinking about suicide
Other symptoms
Wilson disease can also cause other symptoms such as:
Weak, fragile bones (osteoporosis)
Pain and swelling in joints (arthritis)
Not having enough healthy red blood cells (anemia)
Lower than normal levels of platelets or white blood cells
The symptoms of Wilson disease may look like other health problems. Always see your healthcare provider for a diagnosis.
Who’s at risk for Wilson disease?
Wilson disease is rare. You are more likely to have the disease if you have a family history of the disorder. Wilson disease affects both men and women equally.
How is Wilson disease diagnosed?
Wilson disease can be difficult to diagnose. Many of the symptoms may look like symptoms of other diseases.
To diagnose the condition, your provider will look at your overall health and ask about your past health. He or she will ask about your symptoms and give you a physical exam.
You may also have the following tests:
Eye exam. Your provider uses a special lamp (a slit lamp) to check for brown Kayser-Fleischer rings in your eyes.
Blood tests. These can check the copper level in your blood and also detect any liver problems.
24-hour urine test. This measures the amount of copper in your urine over 24 hours.
Liver biopsy. A small sample of your liver is removed for testing.
Genetic testing. A blood test can identify the abnormal genes that cause Wilson disease.
How is Wilson disease treated?
Treatment will depend on your symptoms, age, and general health. It will also depend on how severe the condition is.
There is no cure for Wilson disease. Lifelong treatment is needed to reduce the amount of copper in your body.
Treatment may include:
Taking medicines to help your body’s organs and tissues get rid of extra copper (copper-chelating medicines)
Reducing the amount of copper you get through food
Taking zinc supplements. Zinc prevents your body from absorbing copper from your diet.
Getting extra vitamin B6
Taking medicines to treat symptoms such as muscle tremors or stiffness
Getting a liver transplant, if you have severe liver damage
Early treatment can help prevent severe problems.
What are the complications of Wilson disease?
Wilson disease can lead to many liver-related problems including:
Liver damage
Inflammation of the liver (hepatitis)
Chronic liver damage (cirrhosis) causing scarring and liver failure
Liver failure
Neurological symptoms can make it difficult for you to function normally. In rare cases, Wilson disease can be fatal.
What can I do to prevent Wilson disease?
There is no way to prevent Wilson disease. Genetic counseling may help you find out if your current or future children are at risk for the disorder.
Talk to your health care provider about genetic testing if you have a family or personal history of the condition. When someone has Wilson disease, their brothers or sisters should be tested. More distant relatives who have neurological or liver symptoms should also be tested.
Living with Wilson disease
Your provider may suggest you take medicine to help keep your copper level under control. You may also need to change your diet to help reduce your copper intake. These dietary changes include:
Not eating shellfish
Not eating liver
Limiting or not eating mushrooms
Limiting or not eating nuts
Limiting or  not eating dried fruits
Limiting or not eating chocolate
Not taking multivitamins that have copper
It's also important to see your provider for regular follow-up visits and lab tests to make sure your copper levels are under control.
If you want to get pregnant or you are pregnant, tell your provider. You may need to change the amount of medicine you take while you are pregnant.
Talk with your provider about other things you can do to keep your liver healthy. This includes getting vaccines for hepatitis A and B.
When should I call my healthcare provider?
Call your provider if you have psychological symptoms that get worse, such as thoughts of suicide.
Also call your provider if you show signs of possible liver failure, such as:
Feeling sleepy more often
Increasing confusion
Weight gain and increased fluid in the abdomen
Yellowing of your skin or eyes
Key points
Wilson disease is a rare genetic disorder that prevents your body from getting rid of extra copper in your system.
Too much copper builds up in your liver. The copper collects in other organs as well as in your eyes and brain.
Your organs become damaged. Over time it can be life-threatening.
It can be difficult to diagnose. Many of the symptoms are also symptoms of other diseases.
There is no cure. Lifelong treatment is needed to reduce the amount of copper in your body.
